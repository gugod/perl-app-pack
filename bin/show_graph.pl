  #pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
  #pod
  #pod Hashes are great for storing named data, but if you want more than one entry
  #pod for a name, you have to use a list of pairs.  Even then, this is really boring
  #pod to write:
  #pod
  #pod   $values = [
  #pod     foo => undef,
  #pod     bar => undef,
  #pod     baz => undef,
  #pod     xyz => { ... },
  #pod   ];
  #pod
  #pod Just look at all those undefs!  Don't worry, we can get rid of those:
  #pod
  #pod   $values = [
  #pod     map { $_ => undef } qw(foo bar baz),
  #pod     xyz => { ... },
  #pod   ];
  #pod
  #pod Aaaauuugh!  We've saved a little typing, but now it requires thought to read,
  #pod and thinking is even worse than typing... and it's got a bug!  It looked right,
  #pod didn't it?  Well, the C<< xyz => { ... } >> gets consumed by the map, and we
  #pod don't get the data we wanted.
  #pod
  #pod With Data::OptList, you can do this instead:
  #pod
  #pod   $values = Data::OptList::mkopt([
  #pod     qw(foo bar baz),
  #pod     xyz => { ... },
  #pod   ]);
  #pod
  #pod This works by assuming that any defined scalar is a name and any reference
  #pod following a name is its value.
  #pod
  #pod =func mkopt
  #pod
  #pod   my $opt_list = Data::OptList::mkopt($input, \%arg);
  #pod
  #pod Valid arguments are:
  #pod
  #pod   moniker        - a word used in errors to describe the opt list; encouraged
  #pod   require_unique - if true, no name may appear more than once
  #pod   must_be        - types to which opt list values are limited (described below)
  #pod   name_test      - a coderef used to test whether a value can be a name
  #pod                    (described below, but you probably don't want this)
  #pod
  #pod This produces an array of arrays; the inner arrays are name/value pairs.
  #pod Values will be either "undef" or a reference.
  #pod
  #pod Positional parameters may be used for compatibility with the old C<mkopt>
  #pod interface:
  #pod
  #pod   my $opt_list = Data::OptList::mkopt($input, $moniker, $req_uni, $must_be);
  #pod
  #pod Valid values for C<$input>:
  #pod
  #pod  undef    -> []
  #pod  hashref  -> [ [ key1 => value1 ] ... ] # non-ref values become undef
  #pod  arrayref -> every name followed by a non-name becomes a pair: [ name => ref ]
  #pod              every name followed by undef becomes a pair: [ name => undef ]
  #pod              otherwise, it becomes [ name => undef ] like so:
  #pod              [ "a", "b", [ 1, 2 ] ] -> [ [ a => undef ], [ b => [ 1, 2 ] ] ]
  #pod
  #pod By default, a I<name> is any defined non-reference.  The C<name_test> parameter
  #pod can be a code ref that tests whether the argument passed it is a name or not.
  #pod This should be used rarely.  Interactions between C<require_unique> and
  #pod C<name_test> are not yet particularly elegant, as C<require_unique> just tests
  #pod string equality.  B<This may change.>
  #pod
  #pod The C<must_be> parameter is either a scalar or array of scalars; it defines
  #pod what kind(s) of refs may be values.  If an invalid value is found, an exception
  #pod is thrown.  If no value is passed for this argument, any reference is valid.
  #pod If C<must_be> specifies that values must be CODE, HASH, ARRAY, or SCALAR, then
  #pod Params::Util is used to check whether the given value can provide that
  #pod interface.  Otherwise, it checks that the given value is an object of the kind.
  #pod
  #pod In other words:
  #pod
  #pod   [ qw(SCALAR HASH Object::Known) ]
  #pod
  #pod Means:
  #pod
  #pod   _SCALAR0($value) or _HASH($value) or _INSTANCE($value, 'Object::Known')

  =head1 NAME
  
  Sub::Exporter - a sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.987
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  Sub::Exporter must be used in two places.  First, in an exporting module:
  
    # in the exporting module:
    package Text::Tweaker;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
      exports => [
        qw(squish titlecase), # always works the same way
        reformat => \&build_reformatter, # generator to build exported function
        trim     => \&build_trimmer,
        indent   => \&build_indenter,
      ],
      collectors => [ 'defaults' ],
    };
  
  Then, in an importing module:
  
    # in the importing module:
    use Text::Tweaker
      'squish',
      indent   => { margin => 5 },
      reformat => { width => 79, justify => 'full', -as => 'prettify_text' },
      defaults => { eol => 'CRLF' };
  
  With this setup, the importing module ends up with three routines: C<squish>,
  C<indent>, and C<prettify_text>.  The latter two have been built to the
  specifications of the importer -- they are not just copies of the code in the
  exporting package.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<ACHTUNG!>  If you're not familiar with Exporter or exporting, read
  L<Sub::Exporter::Tutorial> first!
  
  =head2 Why Generators?
  
  The biggest benefit of Sub::Exporter over existing exporters (including the
  ubiquitous Exporter.pm) is its ability to build new coderefs for export, rather
  than to simply export code identical to that found in the exporting package.
  
  If your module's consumers get a routine that works like this:
  
    use Data::Analyze qw(analyze);
    my $value = analyze($data, $tolerance, $passes);
  
  and they constantly pass only one or two different set of values for the
  non-C<$data> arguments, your code can benefit from Sub::Exporter.  By writing a
  simple generator, you can let them do this, instead:
  
    use Data::Analyze
      analyze => { tolerance => 0.10, passes => 10, -as => analyze10 },
      analyze => { tolerance => 0.15, passes => 50, -as => analyze50 };
  
    my $value = analyze10($data);
  
  The package with the generator for that would look something like this:
  
    package Data::Analyze;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
      exports => [
        analyze => \&build_analyzer,
      ],
    };
  
    sub build_analyzer {
      my ($class, $name, $arg) = @_;
  
      return sub {
        my $data      = shift;
        my $tolerance = shift || $arg->{tolerance}; 
        my $passes    = shift || $arg->{passes}; 
  
        analyze($data, $tolerance, $passes);
      }
    }
  
  Your module's user now has to do less work to benefit from it -- and remember,
  you're often your own user!  Investing in customized subroutines is an
  investment in future laziness.
  
  This also avoids a common form of ugliness seen in many modules: package-level
  configuration.  That is, you might have seen something like the above
  implemented like so:
  
    use Data::Analyze qw(analyze);
    $Data::Analyze::default_tolerance = 0.10;
    $Data::Analyze::default_passes    = 10;
  
  This might save time, until you have multiple modules using Data::Analyze.
  Because there is only one global configuration, they step on each other's toes
  and your code begins to have mysterious errors.
  
  Generators can also allow you to export class methods to be called as
  subroutines:
  
    package Data::Methodical;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => { exports => { some_method => \&_curry_class } };
  
    sub _curry_class {
      my ($class, $name) = @_;
      sub { $class->$name(@_); };
    }
  
  Because of the way that exporters and Sub::Exporter work, any package that
  inherits from Data::Methodical can inherit its exporter and override its
  C<some_method>.  If a user imports C<some_method> from that package, he'll
  receive a subroutine that calls the method on the subclass, rather than on
  Data::Methodical itself.
  
  =head2 Other Customizations
  
  Building custom routines with generators isn't the only way that Sub::Exporters
  allows the importing code to refine its use of the exported routines.  They may
  also be renamed to avoid naming collisions.
  
  Consider the following code:
  
    # this program determines to which circle of Hell you will be condemned
    use Morality qw(sin virtue); # for calculating viciousness
    use Math::Trig qw(:all);     # for dealing with circles
  
  The programmer has inadvertently imported two C<sin> routines.  The solution,
  in Exporter.pm-based modules, would be to import only one and then call the
  other by its fully-qualified name.  Alternately, the importer could write a
  routine that did so, or could mess about with typeglobs.
  
  How much easier to write:
  
    # this program determines to which circle of Hell you will be condemned
    use Morality qw(virtue), sin => { -as => 'offense' };
    use Math::Trig -all => { -prefix => 'trig_' };
  
  and to have at one's disposal C<offense> and C<trig_sin> -- not to mention
  C<trig_cos> and C<trig_tan>.
  
  =head1 EXPORTER CONFIGURATION
  
  You can configure an exporter for your package by using Sub::Exporter like so:
  
    package Tools;
    use Sub::Exporter
      -setup => { exports => [ qw(function1 function2 function3) ] };
  
  This is the simplest way to use the exporter, and is basically equivalent to
  this:
  
    package Tools;
    use base qw(Exporter);
    our @EXPORT_OK = qw(function1 function2 function3);
  
  Any basic use of Sub::Exporter will look like this:
  
    package Tools;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => \%config;
  
  The following keys are valid in C<%config>:
  
    exports - a list of routines to provide for exporting; each routine may be
              followed by generator
    groups  - a list of groups to provide for exporting; each must be followed by
              either (a) a list of exports, possibly with arguments for each
              export, or (b) a generator
  
    collectors - a list of names into which values are collected for use in
                 routine generation; each name may be followed by a validator
  
  In addition to the basic options above, a few more advanced options may be
  passed:
  
    into_level - how far up the caller stack to look for a target (default 0)
    into       - an explicit target (package) into which to export routines
  
  In other words: Sub::Exporter installs a C<import> routine which, when called,
  exports routines to the calling namespace.  The C<into> and C<into_level>
  options change where those exported routines are installed.
  
    generator  - a callback used to produce the code that will be installed
                 default: Sub::Exporter::default_generator
  
    installer  - a callback used to install the code produced by the generator
                 default: Sub::Exporter::default_installer
  
  For information on how these callbacks are used, see the documentation for
  C<L</default_generator>> and C<L</default_installer>>.
  
  =head2 Export Configuration
  
  The C<exports> list may be provided as an array reference or a hash reference.
  The list is processed in such a way that the following are equivalent:
  
    { exports => [ qw(foo bar baz), quux => \&quux_generator ] }
  
    { exports =>
      { foo => undef, bar => undef, baz => undef, quux => \&quux_generator } }
  
  Generators are code that return coderefs.  They are called with four
  parameters:
  
    $class - the class whose exporter has been called (the exporting class)
    $name  - the name of the export for which the routine is being build
   \%arg   - the arguments passed for this export
   \%col   - the collections for this import
  
  Given the configuration in the L</SYNOPSIS>, the following C<use> statement:
  
    use Text::Tweaker
      reformat => { -as => 'make_narrow', width => 33 },
      defaults => { eol => 'CR' };
  
  would result in the following call to C<&build_reformatter>:
  
    my $code = build_reformatter(
      'Text::Tweaker',
      'reformat',
      { width => 33 }, # note that -as is not passed in
      { defaults => { eol => 'CR' } },
    );
  
  The returned coderef (C<$code>) would then be installed as C<make_narrow> in the
  calling package.
  
  Instead of providing a coderef in the configuration, a reference to a method
  name may be provided.  This method will then be called on the invocant of the
  C<import> method.  (In this case, we do not pass the C<$class> parameter, as it
  would be redundant.)
  
  =head2 Group Configuration
  
  The C<groups> list can be passed in the same forms as C<exports>.  Groups must
  have values to be meaningful, which may either list exports that make up the
  group (optionally with arguments) or may provide a way to build the group.
  
  The simpler case is the first: a group definition is a list of exports.  Here's
  the example that could go in exporter in the L</SYNOPSIS>.
  
    groups  => {
      default    => [ qw(reformat) ],
      shorteners => [ qw(squish trim) ],
      email_safe => [
        'indent',
        reformat => { -as => 'email_format', width => 72 }
      ],
    },
  
  Groups are imported by specifying their name prefixed be either a dash or a
  colon.  This line of code would import the C<shorteners> group:
  
    use Text::Tweaker qw(-shorteners);
  
  Arguments passed to a group when importing are merged into the groups options
  and passed to any relevant generators.  Groups can contain other groups, but
  looping group structures are ignored.
  
  The other possible value for a group definition, a coderef, allows one
  generator to build several exportable routines simultaneously.  This is useful
  when many routines must share enclosed lexical variables.  The coderef must
  return a hash reference.  The keys will be used as export names and the values
  are the subs that will be exported.
  
  This example shows a simple use of the group generator.
  
    package Data::Crypto;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => { groups => { cipher => \&build_cipher_group } };
  
    sub build_cipher_group {
      my ($class, $group, $arg) = @_;
      my ($encode, $decode) = build_codec($arg->{secret});
      return { cipher => $encode, decipher => $decode };
    }
  
  The C<cipher> and C<decipher> routines are built in a group because they are
  built together by code which encloses their secret in their environment.
  
  =head3 Default Groups
  
  If a module that uses Sub::Exporter is C<use>d with no arguments, it will try
  to export the group named C<default>.  If that group has not been specifically
  configured, it will be empty, and nothing will happen.
  
  Another group is also created if not defined: C<all>.  The C<all> group
  contains all the exports from the exports list.
  
  =head2 Collector Configuration
  
  The C<collectors> entry in the exporter configuration gives names which, when
  found in the import call, have their values collected and passed to every
  generator.
  
  For example, the C<build_analyzer> generator that we saw above could be
  rewritten as:
  
   sub build_analyzer {
     my ($class, $name, $arg, $col) = @_;
  
     return sub {
       my $data      = shift;
       my $tolerance = shift || $arg->{tolerance} || $col->{defaults}{tolerance}; 
       my $passes    = shift || $arg->{passes}    || $col->{defaults}{passes}; 
  
       analyze($data, $tolerance, $passes);
     }
   }
  
  That would allow the importer to specify global defaults for his imports:
  
    use Data::Analyze
      'analyze',
      analyze  => { tolerance => 0.10, -as => analyze10 },
      analyze  => { tolerance => 0.15, passes => 50, -as => analyze50 },
      defaults => { passes => 10 };
  
    my $A = analyze10($data);     # equivalent to analyze($data, 0.10, 10);
    my $C = analyze50($data);     # equivalent to analyze($data, 0.15, 50);
    my $B = analyze($data, 0.20); # equivalent to analyze($data, 0.20, 10);
  
  If values are provided in the C<collectors> list during exporter setup, they
  must be code references, and are used to validate the importer's values.  The
  validator is called when the collection is found, and if it returns false, an
  exception is thrown.  We could ensure that no one tries to set a global data
  default easily:
  
    collectors => { defaults => sub { return (exists $_[0]->{data}) ? 0 : 1 } }
  
  Collector coderefs can also be used as hooks to perform arbitrary actions
  before anything is exported.
  
  When the coderef is called, it is passed the value of the collection and a
  hashref containing the following entries:
  
    name        - the name of the collector
    config      - the exporter configuration (hashref)
    import_args - the arguments passed to the exporter, sans collections (aref)
    class       - the package on which the importer was called
    into        - the package into which exports will be exported
  
  Collectors with all-caps names (that is, made up of underscore or capital A
  through Z) are reserved for special use.  The only currently implemented
  special collector is C<INIT>, whose hook (if present in the exporter
  configuration) is always run before any other hook.
  
  =head1 CALLING THE EXPORTER
  
  Arguments to the exporter (that is, the arguments after the module name in a
  C<use> statement) are parsed as follows:
  
  First, the collectors gather any collections found in the arguments.  Any
  reference type may be given as the value for a collector.  For each collection
  given in the arguments, its validator (if any) is called.  
  
  Next, groups are expanded.  If the group is implemented by a group generator,
  the generator is called.  There are two special arguments which, if given to a
  group, have special meaning:
  
    -prefix - a string to prepend to any export imported from this group
    -suffix - a string to append to any export imported from this group
  
  Finally, individual export generators are called and all subs, generated or
  otherwise, are installed in the calling package.  There is only one special
  argument for export generators:
  
    -as     - where to install the exported sub
  
  Normally, C<-as> will contain an alternate name for the routine.  It may,
  however, contain a reference to a scalar.  If that is the case, a reference the
  generated routine will be placed in the scalar referenced by C<-as>.  It will
  not be installed into the calling package.
  
  =head2 Special Exporter Arguments
  
  The generated exporter accept some special options, which may be passed as the
  first argument, in a hashref.
  
  These options are:
  
    into_level
    into
    generator
    installer
  
  These override the same-named configuration options described in L</EXPORTER
  CONFIGURATION>.
  
  =head1 SUBROUTINES
  
  =head2 setup_exporter
  
  This routine builds and installs an C<import> routine.  It is called with one
  argument, a hashref containing the exporter configuration.  Using this, it
  builds an exporter and installs it into the calling package with the name
  "import."  In addition to the normal exporter configuration, a few named
  arguments may be passed in the hashref:
  
    into       - into what package should the exporter be installed
    into_level - into what level up the stack should the exporter be installed
    as         - what name should the installed exporter be given
  
  By default the exporter is installed with the name C<import> into the immediate
  caller of C<setup_exporter>.  In other words, if your package calls
  C<setup_exporter> without providing any of the three above arguments, it will
  have an C<import> routine installed.
  
  Providing both C<into> and C<into_level> will cause an exception to be thrown.
  
  The exporter is built by C<L</build_exporter>>.
  
  =head2 build_exporter
  
  Given a standard exporter configuration, this routine builds and returns an
  exporter -- that is, a subroutine that can be installed as a class method to
  perform exporting on request.
  
  Usually, this method is called by C<L</setup_exporter>>, which then installs
  the exporter as a package's import routine.
  
  =head2 default_generator
  
  This is Sub::Exporter's default generator.  It takes bits of configuration that
  have been gathered during the import and turns them into a coderef that can be
  installed.
  
    my $code = default_generator(\%arg);
  
  Passed arguments are:
  
    class - the class on which the import method was called
    name  - the name of the export being generated
    arg   - the arguments to the generator
    col   - the collections
  
    generator - the generator to be used to build the export (code or scalar ref)
  
  =head2 default_installer
  
  This is Sub::Exporter's default installer.  It does what Sub::Exporter
  promises: it installs code into the target package.
  
    default_installer(\%arg, \@to_export);
  
  Passed arguments are:
  
    into - the package into which exports should be delivered
  
  C<@to_export> is a list of name/value pairs.  The default exporter assigns code
  (the values) to named slots (the names) in the given package.  If the name is a
  scalar reference, the scalar reference is made to point to the code reference
  instead.
  
  =head1 EXPORTS
  
  Sub::Exporter also offers its own exports: the C<setup_exporter> and
  C<build_exporter> routines described above.  It also provides a special "setup"
  collector, which will set up an exporter using the parameters passed to it.
  
  Note that the "setup" collector (seen in examples like the L</SYNOPSIS> above)
  uses C<build_exporter>, not C<setup_exporter>.  This means that the special
  arguments like "into" and "as" for C<setup_exporter> are not accepted here.
  Instead, you may write something like:
  
    use Sub::Exporter
      { into => 'Target::Package' },
      -setup => {
        -as     => 'do_import',
        exports => [ ... ],
      }
    ;
  
  Finding a good reason for wanting to do this is left as an exercise for the
  reader.
  
  =head1 COMPARISONS
  
  There are a whole mess of exporters on the CPAN.  The features included in
  Sub::Exporter set it apart from any existing Exporter.  Here's a summary of
  some other exporters and how they compare.
  
  =over
  
  =item * L<Exporter> and co.
  
  This is the standard Perl exporter.  Its interface is a little clunky, but it's
  fast and ubiquitous.  It can do some things that Sub::Exporter can't:  it can
  export things other than routines, it can import "everything in this group
  except this symbol," and some other more esoteric things.  These features seem
  to go nearly entirely unused.
  
  It always exports things exactly as they appear in the exporting module; it
  can't rename or customize routines.  Its groups ("tags") can't be nested.
  
  L<Exporter::Lite> is a whole lot like Exporter, but it does significantly less:
  it supports exporting symbols, but not groups, pattern matching, or negation.
  
  The fact that Sub::Exporter can't export symbols other than subroutines is
  a good idea, not a missing feature.
  
  For simple uses, setting up Sub::Exporter is about as easy as Exporter.  For
  complex uses, Sub::Exporter makes hard things possible, which would not be
  possible with Exporter. 
  
  When using a module that uses Sub::Exporter, users familiar with Exporter will
  probably see no difference in the basics.  These two lines do about the same
  thing in whether the exporting module uses Exporter or Sub::Exporter.
  
    use Some::Module qw(foo bar baz);
    use Some::Module qw(foo :bar baz);
  
  The definition for exporting in Exporter.pm might look like this:
  
    package Some::Module;
    use base qw(Exporter);
    our @EXPORT_OK   = qw(foo bar baz quux);
    our %EXPORT_TAGS = (bar => [ qw(bar baz) ]);
  
  Using Sub::Exporter, it would look like this:
  
    package Some::Module;
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
      exports => [ qw(foo bar baz quux) ],
      groups  => { bar => [ qw(bar baz) ]}
    };
  
  Sub::Exporter respects inheritance, so that a package may export inherited
  routines, and will export the most inherited version.  Exporting methods
  without currying away the invocant is a bad idea, but Sub::Exporter allows you
  to do just that -- and anyway, there are other uses for this feature, like
  packages of exported subroutines which use inheritance specifically to allow
  more specialized, but similar, packages.
  
  L<Exporter::Easy> provides a wrapper around the standard Exporter.  It makes it
  simpler to build groups, but doesn't provide any more functionality.  Because
  it is a front-end to Exporter, it will store your exporter's configuration in
  global package variables.
  
  =item * Attribute-Based Exporters
  
  Some exporters use attributes to mark variables to export.  L<Exporter::Simple>
  supports exporting any kind of symbol, and supports groups.  Using a module
  like Exporter or Sub::Exporter, it's easy to look at one place and see what is
  exported, but it's impossible to look at a variable definition and see whether
  it is exported by that alone.  Exporter::Simple makes this trade in reverse:
  each variable's declaration includes its export definition, but there is no one
  place to look to find a manifest of exports.
  
  More importantly, Exporter::Simple does not add any new features to those of
  Exporter.  In fact, like Exporter::Easy, it is just a front-end to Exporter, so
  it ends up storing its configuration in global package variables.  (This means
  that there is one place to look for your exporter's manifest, actually.  You
  can inspect the C<@EXPORT> package variables, and other related package
  variables, at runtime.)
  
  L<Perl6::Export> isn't actually attribute based, but looks similar.  Its syntax
  is borrowed from Perl 6, and implemented by a source filter.  It is a prototype
  of an interface that is still being designed.  It should probably be avoided
  for production work.  On the other hand, L<Perl6::Export::Attrs> implements
  Perl 6-like exporting, but translates it into Perl 5 by providing attributes.
  
  =item * Other Exporters
  
  L<Exporter::Renaming> wraps the standard Exporter to allow it to export symbols
  with changed names.
  
  L<Class::Exporter> performs a special kind of routine generation, giving each
  importing package an instance of your class, and then exporting the instance's
  methods as normal routines.  (Sub::Exporter, of course, can easily emulate this
  behavior, as shown above.)
  
  L<Exporter::Tidy> implements a form of renaming (using its C<_map> argument)
  and of prefixing, and implements groups.  It also avoids using package
  variables for its configuration.

  =head1 TODO
  
  =over

  =head1 THANKS
  
  Hans Dieter Pearcey provided helpful advice while I was writing Sub::Exporter.
  Ian Langworth and Shawn Sorichetti asked some good questions and helped me
  improve my documentation quite a bit.  Yuval Kogman helped me find a bunch of
  little problems.
  
  Thanks, guys!

  Sub::Exporter::Util - utilities to make Sub::Exporter easier
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.987
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides a number of utility functions for performing common or
  useful operations when setting up a Sub::Exporter configuration.  All of the
  utilities may be exported, but none are by default.
  
  =head1 THE UTILITIES
  
  =head2 curry_method
  
    exports => {
      some_method => curry_method,
    }
  
  This utility returns a generator which will produce an invocant-curried version
  of a method.  In other words, it will export a method call with the exporting
  class built in as the invocant.
  
  A module importing the code some the above example might do this:
  
    use Some::Module qw(some_method);
  
    my $x = some_method;
  
  This would be equivalent to:
  
    use Some::Module;
  
    my $x = Some::Module->some_method;
  
  If Some::Module is subclassed and the subclass's import method is called to
  import C<some_method>, the subclass will be curried in as the invocant.
  
  If an argument is provided for C<curry_method> it is used as the name of the
  curried method to export.  This means you could export a Widget constructor
  like this:
  
    exports => { widget => curry_method('new') }
  
  This utility may also be called as C<curry_class>, for backwards compatibility.
  
  =head2 curry_chain
  
  C<curry_chain> behaves like C<L</curry_method>>, but is meant for generating
  exports that will call several methods in succession.
  
    exports => {
      reticulate => curry_chain(
        new => gather_data => analyze => [ detail => 100 ] => 'results'
      ),
    }
  
  If imported from Spliner, calling the C<reticulate> routine will be equivalent
  to:
  
    Spliner->new->gather_data->analyze(detail => 100)->results;
  
  If any method returns something on which methods may not be called, the routine
  croaks.
  
  The arguments to C<curry_chain> form an optlist.  The names are methods to be
  called and the arguments, if given, are arrayrefs to be dereferenced and passed
  as arguments to those methods.  C<curry_chain> returns a generator like those
  expected by Sub::Exporter.
  
  B<Achtung!> at present, there is no way to pass arguments from the generated
  routine to the method calls.  This will probably be solved in future revisions
  by allowing the opt list's values to be subroutines that will be called with
  the generated routine's stack.
  
  =head2 merge_col
  
    exports => {
      merge_col(defaults => {
        twiddle => \'_twiddle_gen',
        tweak   => \&_tweak_gen,
      }),
    }
  
  This utility wraps the given generator in one that will merge the named
  collection into its args before calling it.  This means that you can support a
  "default" collector in multiple exports without writing the code each time.
  
  You can specify as many pairs of collection names and generators as you like.
  
  =head2 mixin_installer
  
    use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
      installer => Sub::Exporter::Util::mixin_installer,
      exports   => [ qw(foo bar baz) ],
    };
  
  This utility returns an installer that will install into a superclass and
  adjust the ISA importing class to include the newly generated superclass.
  
  If the target of importing is an object, the hierarchy is reversed: the new
  class will be ISA the object's class, and the object will be reblessed.
  
  B<Prerequisites>: This utility requires that Package::Generator be installed.
  
  =head2 like
  
  It's a collector that adds imports for anything like given regex.
  
  If you provide this configuration:
  
    exports    => [ qw(igrep imap islurp exhausted) ],
    collectors => { -like => Sub::Exporter::Util::like },
  
  A user may import from your module like this:
  
    use Your::Iterator -like => qr/^i/; # imports igre, imap, islurp
  
  or
  
    use Your::Iterator -like => [ qr/^i/ => { -prefix => 'your_' } ];
  
  The group-like prefix and suffix arguments are respected; other arguments are
  passed on to the generators for matching exports.

  Sub::Install - install subroutines into packages easily
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.928
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Sub::Install;
  
    Sub::Install::install_sub({
      code => sub { ... },
      into => $package,
      as   => $subname
    });
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module makes it easy to install subroutines into packages without the
  unsightly mess of C<no strict> or typeglobs lying about where just anyone can
  see them.
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 install_sub
  
    Sub::Install::install_sub({
     code => \&subroutine,
     into => "Finance::Shady",
     as   => 'launder',
    });
  
  This routine installs a given code reference into a package as a normal
  subroutine.  The above is equivalent to:
  
    no strict 'refs';
    *{"Finance::Shady" . '::' . "launder"} = \&subroutine;
  
  If C<into> is not given, the sub is installed into the calling package.
  
  If C<code> is not a code reference, it is looked for as an existing sub in the
  package named in the C<from> parameter.  If C<from> is not given, it will look
  in the calling package.
  
  If C<as> is not given, and if C<code> is a name, C<as> will default to C<code>.
  If C<as> is not given, but if C<code> is a code ref, Sub::Install will try to
  find the name of the given code ref and use that as C<as>.
  
  That means that this code:
  
    Sub::Install::install_sub({
      code => 'twitch',
      from => 'Person::InPain',
      into => 'Person::Teenager',
      as   => 'dance',
    });
  
  is the same as:
  
    package Person::Teenager;
  
    Sub::Install::install_sub({
      code => Person::InPain->can('twitch'),
      as   => 'dance',
    });
  
  =head2 reinstall_sub
  
  This routine behaves exactly like C<L</install_sub>>, but does not emit a

   Sub::Install::install_installers('UNIVERSAL'); # feeling lucky, punk?

      );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<List::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being
  individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<List::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions all reduce a list down to a single value.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 reduce
  
      $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list
  
  Reduces C<@list> by calling C<BLOCK> in a scalar context multiple times,
  setting C<$a> and C<$b> each time. The first call will be with C<$a> and C<$b>
  set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be done by
  setting C<$a> to the result of the previous call and C<$b> to the next element
  in the list.
  
  Returns the result of the last call to the C<BLOCK>. If C<@list> is empty then
  C<undef> is returned. If C<@list> only contains one element then that element
  is returned and C<BLOCK> is not executed.
  
  The following examples all demonstrate how C<reduce> could be used to implement
  the other list-reduction functions in this module. (They are not in fact
  implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient manner in individual C
  functions).
  
      $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
                      $code->(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
                                               undef } undef, @list # first
  
      $foo = reduce { $a > $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
      $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } 'A'..'Z'   # maxstr
      $foo = reduce { $a < $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
      $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } 'aa'..'zz' # minstr
      $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
      $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat
  
      $foo = reduce { $a || $code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
      $foo = reduce { $a && $code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
      $foo = reduce { $a && !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
      $foo = reduce { $a || !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
         # Note that these implementations do not fully short-circuit
  
  If your algorithm requires that C<reduce> produce an identity value, then make
  sure that you always pass that identity value as the first argument to prevent
  C<undef> being returned
  
    $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value
  
  The above example code blocks also suggest how to use C<reduce> to build a
  more efficient combined version of one of these basic functions and a C<map>
  block. For example, to find the total length of all the strings in a list,
  we could use
  
      $total = sum map { length } @strings;
  
  However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the
  original list of strings, only to reduce it down to a single value again. We
  can compute the same result more efficiently by using C<reduce> with a code
  block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:
  
      $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings
  
  The remaining list-reduction functions are all specialisations of this generic
  idea.
  
  =head2 any
  
      my $bool = any { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<any> returns true if any element makes the C<BLOCK>
  return a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty then
  it returns false.
  
  Many cases of using C<grep> in a conditional can be written using C<any>
  instead, as it can short-circuit after the first true result.
  
      if( any { length > 10 } @strings ) {
          # at least one string has more than 10 characters
      }
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 all
  
      my $bool = all { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any>, except that it requires all elements of the C<@list> to
  make the C<BLOCK> return true. If any element returns false, then it returns
  false. If the C<BLOCK> never returns false or the C<@list> was empty then it
  returns true.
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 none
  
  =head2 notall
  
      my $bool = none { BLOCK } @list;
  
      my $bool = notall { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any> and L</all>, but with the return sense inverted. C<none>
  returns true only if no value in the C<@list> causes the C<BLOCK> to return
  true, and C<notall> returns true only if not all of the values do.
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 first
  
      my $val = first { BLOCK } @list;
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<first> returns the first element where the result from
  C<BLOCK> is a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty
  then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = first { defined($_) } @list    # first defined value in @list
      $foo = first { $_ > $value } @list    # first value in @list which
                                            # is greater than $value
  
  =head2 max
  
      my $num = max @list;
  
  Returns the entry in the list with the highest numerical value. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = max 1..10                # 10
      $foo = max 3,9,12               # 12
      $foo = max @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 maxstr
  
      my $str = maxstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</max>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the highest string as defined by the C<gt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = maxstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'Z'
      $foo = maxstr "hello","world"   # "world"
      $foo = maxstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 min
  
      my $num = min @list;
  
  Similar to L</max> but returns the entry in the list with the lowest numerical
  value. If the list is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = min 1..10                # 1
      $foo = min 3,9,12               # 3
      $foo = min @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 minstr
  
      my $str = minstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</min>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the lowest string as defined by the C<lt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = minstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'A'
      $foo = minstr "hello","world"   # "hello"
      $foo = minstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 product
  
      my $num = product @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.35.>
  
  Returns the numerical product of all the elements in C<@list>. If C<@list> is
  empty then C<1> is returned.
  
      $foo = product 1..10            # 3628800
      $foo = product 3,9,12           # 324
  
  =head2 sum
  
      my $num_or_undef = sum @list;
  
  Returns the numerical sum of all the elements in C<@list>. For backwards
  compatibility, if C<@list> is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = sum 1..10                # 55
      $foo = sum 3,9,12               # 24
      $foo = sum @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 sum0
  
      my $num = sum0 @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  Similar to L</sum>, except this returns 0 when given an empty list, rather
  than C<undef>.

  =head1 KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions, all inspired by L<List::Pairwise>, consume an
  even-sized list of pairs. The pairs may be key/value associations from a hash,
  or just a list of values. The functions will all preserve the original ordering
  of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same "key"
  value - nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.
  
  B<NOTE>: At the time of writing, the following C<pair*> functions that take a
  block do not modify the value of C<$_> within the block, and instead operate
  using the C<$a> and C<$b> globals instead. This has turned out to be a poor
  design, as it precludes the ability to provide a C<pairsort> function. Better
  would be to pass pair-like objects as 2-element array references in C<$_>, in
  a style similar to the return value of the C<pairs> function. At some future
  version this behaviour may be added.
  
  Until then, users are alerted B<NOT> to rely on the value of C<$_> remaining
  unmodified between the outside and the inside of the control block. In
  particular, the following example is B<UNSAFE>:
  
   my @kvlist = ...
  
   foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  Instead, write this using a lexical variable:
  
   foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 pairs
  
      my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of C<ARRAY> references, each containing two items from the
  given list. It is a more efficient version of
  
      @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist
  
  It is most convenient to use in a C<foreach> loop, for example:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
         ...
      }
  
  Since version C<1.39> these C<ARRAY> references are blessed objects,
  recognising the two methods C<key> and C<value>. The following code is
  equivalent:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my $key   = $pair->key;
         my $value = $pair->value;
         ...
      }
  
  =head2 unpairs
  
      my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs
  
  I<Since version 1.42.>
  
  The inverse function to C<pairs>; this function takes a list of C<ARRAY>
  references containing two elements each, and returns a flattened list of the
  two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally equivalent to
  
      my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs
  
  except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for
  any input item it will extract exactly two values for the output list; using
  C<undef> if the input array references are short.
  
  Between C<pairs> and C<unpairs>, a higher-order list function can be used to
  operate on the pairs as single scalars; such as the following near-equivalents
  of the other C<pair*> higher-order functions:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
      @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
  Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.
  
  Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair
  list; e.g.:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a->key cmp $b->key } pairs @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairkeys
  
      my @keys = pairkeys @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the first values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @keys = pairmap { $a } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairvalues
  
      my @values = pairvalues @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the second values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @values = pairmap { $b } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairgrep
  
      my @kvlist = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<grep> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns an even-sized list of those pairs for which the C<BLOCK> returned true
  in list context, or the count of the B<number of pairs> in scalar context.
  (Note, therefore, in scalar context that it returns a number half the size of
  the count of items it would have returned in list context).
  
      @subset = pairgrep { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairgrep> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairfirst
  
      my ( $key, $val ) = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $found = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.30.>
  
  Similar to the L</first> function, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the first pair of values from the list for which the C<BLOCK> returned
  true in list context, or an empty list of no such pair was found. In scalar
  context it returns a simple boolean value, rather than either the key or the
  value found.
  
      ( $key, $value ) = pairfirst { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairfirst> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairmap
  
      my @list = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<map> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in list
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the concatenation of all the values returned by the C<BLOCK> in list
  context, or the count of the number of items that would have been returned in
  scalar context.
  
      @result = pairmap { "The key $a has value $b" } @kvlist
  
  As with C<map> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairmap> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  See L</KNOWN BUGS> for a known-bug with C<pairmap>, and a workaround.

  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 shuffle
  
      my @values = shuffle @values;
  
  Returns the values of the input in a random order
  
      @cards = shuffle 0..51      # 0..51 in a random order
  
  =head2 uniq
  
      my @subset = uniq @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  DWIM-ish string equality or C<undef> test. Preserves the order of unique
  elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniq @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  The C<undef> value is treated by this function as distinct from the empty
  string, and no warning will be produced. It is left as-is in the returned
  list. Subsequent C<undef> values are still considered identical to the first,
  and will be removed.
  
  =head2 uniqnum
  
      my @subset = uniqnum @values
  
  I<Since version 1.44.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  numerical equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains
  the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqnum @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it
  compares equal to zero but additionally produces a warning if such warnings
  are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an C<undef> in
  the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
  values returned by C<uniqnum> are well-behaved as numbers.
  
  Note also that multiple IEEE C<NaN> values are treated as duplicates of
  each other, regardless of any differences in their payloads, and despite
  the fact that C<< 0+'NaN' == 0+'NaN' >> yields false.
  
  =head2 uniqstr
  
      my @subset = uniqstr @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  string equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the
  first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqstr @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other string operations treat it; it
  compares equal to the empty string but additionally produces a warning if such
  warnings are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an
  C<undef> in the returned list is coerced into an empty string, so that the
  entire list of values returned by C<uniqstr> are well-behaved as strings.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 head
  
      my @values = head $size, @list;
  
  Returns the first C<$size> elements from C<@list>. If C<$size> is negative, returns
  all but the last C<$size> elements from C<@list>.
  
      @result = head 2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # foo, bar
  
      @result = head -2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # foo
  
  =head2 tail
  
      my @values = tail $size, @list;
  
  Returns the last C<$size> elements from C<@list>. If C<$size> is negative, returns
  all but the first C<$size> elements from C<@list>.
  
      @result = tail 2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # bar, baz
  
      @result = tail -2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # baz
  
  =head1 KNOWN BUGS
  
  =head2 RT #95409
  
  L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95409>
  
  If the block of code given to L</pairmap> contains lexical variables that are
  captured by a returned closure, and the closure is executed after the block
  has been re-used for the next iteration, these lexicals will not see the
  correct values. For example:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      my $var = "$a is $b";
      sub { print "$var\n" };
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
   $_->() for @subs;
  
  Will incorrectly print
  
   three is 3
   three is 3
   three is 3
  
  This is due to the performance optimisation of using C<MULTICALL> for the code
  block, which means that fresh SVs do not get allocated for each call to the
  block. Instead, the same SV is re-assigned for each iteration, and all the
  closures will share the value seen on the final iteration.
  
  To work around this bug, surround the code with a second set of braces. This
  creates an inner block that defeats the C<MULTICALL> logic, and does get fresh
  SVs allocated each time:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      {
         my $var = "$a is $b";
         sub { print "$var\n"; }
      }
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
  This bug only affects closures that are generated by the block but used
  afterwards. Lexical variables that are only used during the lifetime of the
  block's execution will take their individual values for each invocation, as
  normal.
  
  =head2 uniqnum() on oversized bignums
  
  Due to the way that C<uniqnum()> compares numbers, it cannot distinguish
  differences between bignums (especially bigints) that are too large to fit in
  the native platform types. For example,
  
   my $x = Math::BigInt->new( "1" x 100 );
   my $y = $x + 1;
  
   say for uniqnum( $x, $y );
  
  Will print just the value of C<$x>, believing that C<$y> is a numerically-
  equivalent value. This bug does not affect C<uniqstr()>, which will correctly
  observe that the two values stringify to different strings.
  
  =head1 SUGGESTED ADDITIONS
  
  The following are additions that have been requested, but I have been reluctant
  to add due to them being very simple to implement in perl
  
    # How many elements are true
  
    sub true { scalar grep { $_ } @_ }
  
    # How many elements are false
  
    sub false { scalar grep { !$_ } @_ }

  =head1 NAME
  
  Params::Util - Simple, compact and correct param-checking functions
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    # Import some functions
    use Params::Util qw{_SCALAR _HASH _INSTANCE};
    
    # If you are lazy, or need a lot of them...
    use Params::Util ':ALL';
    
    sub foo {
        my $object  = _INSTANCE(shift, 'Foo') or return undef;
        my $image   = _SCALAR(shift)          or return undef;
        my $options = _HASH(shift)            or return undef;
        # etc...
    }
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Params::Util> provides a basic set of importable functions that makes
  checking parameters a hell of a lot easier
  
  While they can be (and are) used in other contexts, the main point
  behind this module is that the functions B<both> Do What You Mean,
  and Do The Right Thing, so they are most useful when you are getting
  params passed into your code from someone and/or somewhere else
  and you can't really trust the quality.
  
  Thus, C<Params::Util> is of most use at the edges of your API, where
  params and data are coming in from outside your code.
  
  The functions provided by C<Params::Util> check in the most strictly
  correct manner known, are documented as thoroughly as possible so their
  exact behaviour is clear, and heavily tested so make sure they are not
  fooled by weird data and Really Bad Things.
  
  To use, simply load the module providing the functions you want to use
  as arguments (as shown in the SYNOPSIS).
  
  To aid in maintainability, C<Params::Util> will B<never> export by
  default.
  
  You must explicitly name the functions you want to export, or use the
  C<:ALL> param to just have it export everything (although this is not
  recommended if you have any _FOO functions yourself with which future
  additions to C<Params::Util> may clash)

  =head2 _STRING $string
  
  The C<_STRING> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a normal non-false string of non-zero length.
  
  Note that this will NOT do anything magic to deal with the special
  C<'0'> false negative case, but will return it.
  
    # '0' not considered valid data
    my $name = _STRING(shift) or die "Bad name";
    
    # '0' is considered valid data
    my $string = _STRING($_[0]) ? shift : die "Bad string";
  
  Please also note that this function expects a normal string. It does
  not support overloading or other magic techniques to get a string.
  
  Returns the string as a conveince if it is a valid string, or
  C<undef> if not.

  =head2 _IDENTIFIER $string
  
  The C<_IDENTIFIER> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a string that is a valid Perl identifier.
  
  Returns the string as a convenience if it is a valid identifier, or
  C<undef> if not.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_IDENTIFIER;
  sub _IDENTIFIER ($) {
  	(defined $_[0] and ! ref $_[0] and $_[0] =~ m/^[^\W\d]\w*\z/s) ? $_[0] : undef;
  }
  END_PERL
  
  =pod
  
  =head2 _CLASS $string
  
  The C<_CLASS> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a string that is a valid Perl class.
  
  This function only checks that the format is valid, not that the
  class is actually loaded. It also assumes "normalised" form, and does
  not accept class names such as C<::Foo> or C<D'Oh>.
  
  Returns the string as a convenience if it is a valid class name, or
  C<undef> if not.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_CLASS;
  sub _CLASS ($) {
  	(defined $_[0] and ! ref $_[0] and $_[0] =~ m/^[^\W\d]\w*(?:::\w+)*\z/s) ? $_[0] : undef;
  }
  END_PERL
  
  =pod
  
  =head2 _CLASSISA $string, $class
  
  The C<_CLASSISA> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a string that is a particularly class, or a subclass of it.
  
  This function checks that the format is valid and calls the -E<gt>isa
  method on the class name. It does not check that the class is actually
  loaded.
  
  It also assumes "normalised" form, and does
  not accept class names such as C<::Foo> or C<D'Oh>.
  
  Returns the string as a convenience if it is a valid class name, or
  C<undef> if not.
  
  =cut

  }
  END_PERL
  
  =head2 _CLASSDOES $string, $role
  
  This routine behaves exactly like C<L</_CLASSISA>>, but checks with C<< ->DOES
  >> rather than C<< ->isa >>.  This is probably only a good idea to use on Perl
  5.10 or later, when L<UNIVERSAL::DOES|UNIVERSAL::DOES/DOES> has been
  implemented.

  }
  END_PERL
  
  =pod
  
  =head2 _SUBCLASS $string, $class
  
  The C<_SUBCLASS> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a string that is a subclass of a specified class.
  
  This function checks that the format is valid and calls the -E<gt>isa
  method on the class name. It does not check that the class is actually
  loaded.
  
  It also assumes "normalised" form, and does
  not accept class names such as C<::Foo> or C<D'Oh>.
  
  Returns the string as a convenience if it is a valid class name, or
  C<undef> if not.

  =head2 _NUMBER $scalar
  
  The C<_NUMBER> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a number. That is, it is defined and perl thinks it's a number.
  
  This function is basically a Params::Util-style wrapper around the
  L<Scalar::Util> C<looks_like_number> function.
  
  Returns the value as a convience, or C<undef> if the value is not a
  number.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_NUMBER;

  =head2 _POSINT $integer
  
  The C<_POSINT> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a positive integer (of any length).
  
  Returns the value as a convience, or C<undef> if the value is not a
  positive integer.
  
  The name itself is derived from the XML schema constraint of the same
  name.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_POSINT;

  =head2 _NONNEGINT $integer
  
  The C<_NONNEGINT> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to test to see if a value is
  a non-negative integer (of any length). That is, a positive integer,
  or zero.
  
  Returns the value as a convience, or C<undef> if the value is not a
  non-negative integer.
  
  As with other tests that may return false values, care should be taken
  to test via "defined" in boolean validy contexts.
  
    unless ( defined _NONNEGINT($value) ) {
       die "Invalid value";
    }
  
  The name itself is derived from the XML schema constraint of the same

  =head2 _SCALAR \$scalar
  
  The C<_SCALAR> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<SCALAR> reference, with content of non-zero length.
  
  For a version that allows zero length C<SCALAR> references, see
  the C<_SCALAR0> function.
  
  Returns the C<SCALAR> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not a C<SCALAR> reference.
  
  =cut

  =head2 _SCALAR0 \$scalar
  
  The C<_SCALAR0> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<SCALAR0> reference, allowing content of zero-length.
  
  For a simpler "give me some content" version that requires non-zero
  length, C<_SCALAR> function.
  
  Returns the C<SCALAR> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not a C<SCALAR> reference.

  =head2 _ARRAY $value
  
  The C<_ARRAY> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<ARRAY> reference containing B<at least> one element of any kind.
  
  For a more basic form that allows zero length ARRAY references, see
  the C<_ARRAY0> function.
  
  Returns the C<ARRAY> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not an C<ARRAY> reference.

  =head2 _ARRAY0 $value
  
  The C<_ARRAY0> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<ARRAY> reference, allowing C<ARRAY> references that contain no
  elements.
  
  For a more basic "An array of something" form that also requires at
  least one element, see the C<_ARRAY> function.
  
  Returns the C<ARRAY> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not an C<ARRAY> reference.

  The C<_ARRAYLIKE> function tests whether a given scalar value can respond to
  array dereferencing.  If it can, the value is returned.  If it cannot,
  C<_ARRAYLIKE> returns C<undef>.
  
  =cut

  =head2 _HASH $value
  
  The C<_HASH> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<HASH> reference with at least one entry.
  
  For a version of this function that allows the C<HASH> to be empty,
  see the C<_HASH0> function.
  
  Returns the C<HASH> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not an C<HASH> reference.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_HASH;
  sub _HASH ($) {
  	(ref $_[0] eq 'HASH' and scalar %{$_[0]}) ? $_[0] : undef;
  }
  END_PERL
  
  =pod
  
  =head2 _HASH0 $value
  
  The C<_HASH0> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<HASH> reference, regardless of the C<HASH> content.
  
  For a simpler "A hash of something" version that requires at least one
  element, see the C<_HASH> function.
  
  Returns the C<HASH> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not an C<HASH> reference.
  
  =cut

  =pod
  
  =head2 _HASHLIKE $value
  
  The C<_HASHLIKE> function tests whether a given scalar value can respond to
  hash dereferencing.  If it can, the value is returned.  If it cannot,
  C<_HASHLIKE> returns C<undef>.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_HASHLIKE;
  sub _HASHLIKE {
  	(defined $_[0] and ref $_[0] and (

  =head2 _CODE $value
  
  The C<_CODE> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for a raw and unblessed
  C<CODE> reference.
  
  Returns the C<CODE> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef>
  if the value provided is not an C<CODE> reference.
  
  =cut
  
  eval <<'END_PERL' unless defined &_CODE;
  sub _CODE ($) {
  	ref $_[0] eq 'CODE' ? $_[0] : undef;
  }
  END_PERL
  
  =pod
  
  =head2 _CODELIKE $value
  
  The C<_CODELIKE> is the more generic version of C<_CODE>. Unlike C<_CODE>,
  which checks for an explicit C<CODE> reference, the C<_CODELIKE> function
  also includes things that act like them, such as blessed objects that
  overload C<'&{}'>.
  
  Please note that in the case of objects overloaded with '&{}', you will
  almost always end up also testing it in 'bool' context at some stage.
  
  For example:
  
    sub foo {
        my $code1 = _CODELIKE(shift) or die "No code param provided";
        my $code2 = _CODELIKE(shift);
        if ( $code2 ) {
             print "Got optional second code param";
        }
    }
  
  As such, you will most likely always want to make sure your class has
  at least the following to allow it to evaluate to true in boolean
  context.
  
    # Always evaluate to true in boolean context
    use overload 'bool' => sub () { 1 };
  
  Returns the callable value as a convenience, or C<undef> if the
  value provided is not callable.
  
  Note - This function was formerly known as _CALLABLE but has been renamed
  for greater symmetry with the other _XXXXLIKE functions.
  
  The use of _CALLABLE has been deprecated. It will continue to work, but
  with a warning, until end-2006, then will be removed.
  
  I apologise for any inconvenience caused.

  =head2 _INVOCANT $value
  
  This routine tests whether the given value is a valid method invocant.
  This can be either an instance of an object, or a class name.
  
  If so, the value itself is returned.  Otherwise, C<_INVOCANT>
  returns C<undef>.

  =head2 _INSTANCE $object, $class
  
  The C<_INSTANCE> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for an object of a particular class
  in a strictly correct manner.
  
  Returns the object itself as a convenience, or C<undef> if the value
  provided is not an object of that type.

  This routine behaves exactly like C<L</_INSTANCE>>, but checks with C<< ->DOES
  >> rather than C<< ->isa >>.  This is probably only a good idea to use on Perl
  5.10 or later, when L<UNIVERSAL::DOES|UNIVERSAL::DOES/DOES> has been
  implemented.

  The C<_REGEX> function is intended to be imported into your package,

  Returns the value itself as a convenience, or C<undef> if the value
  provided is not a regular expression.

  =head2 _SET \@array, $class
  
  The C<_SET> function is intended to be imported into your package,
  and provides a convenient way to test for set of at least one object of
  a particular class in a strictly correct manner.
  
  The set is provided as a reference to an C<ARRAY> of objects of the
  class provided.
  
  For an alternative function that allows zero-length sets, see the
  C<_SET0> function.
  
  Returns the C<ARRAY> reference itself as a convenience, or C<undef> if

  The set is provided as a reference to an C<ARRAY> of objects of the

  The C<_HANDLE> function is intended to be imported into your package,

  value is a file handle.
  
  Unfortunately, in Perl the definition of a file handle can be a little
  bit fuzzy, so this function is likely to be somewhat imperfect (at first
  anyway).
  
  That said, it is implement as well or better than the other file handle
  detectors in existance (and we stole from the best of them).

  # We're doing this longhand for now. Once everything is perfect,

  The C<_DRIVER> function is intended to be imported into your
  package, and provides a convenient way to load and validate
  a driver class.
  
  The most common pattern when taking a driver class as a parameter
  is to check that the name is a class (i.e. check against _CLASS)
  and then to load the class (if it exists) and then ensure that
  the class returns true for the isa method on some base driver name.
  
  Return the value as a convenience, or C<undef> if the value is not
  a class name, the module does not exist, the module does not load,
  or the class fails the isa test.

  - Add _CAN to help resolve the UNIVERSAL::can debacle
  
  - Would be even nicer if someone would demonstrate how the hell to
  build a Module::Install dist of the ::Util dual Perl/XS type. :/
  
  - Implement an assertion-like version of this module, that dies on
  error.
  
  - Implement a Test:: version of this module, for use in testing

  =head1 NAME
  
  Scalar::Util - A selection of general-utility scalar subroutines
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Scalar::Util qw(blessed dualvar isdual readonly refaddr reftype
                          tainted weaken isweak isvstring looks_like_number
                          set_prototype);
                          # and other useful utils appearing below
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Scalar::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size would be so small that 
  being individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<Scalar::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS FOR REFERENCES
  
  The following functions all perform some useful activity on reference values.
  
  =head2 blessed
  
      my $pkg = blessed( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a blessed reference, the name of the package that it is blessed
  into is returned. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $scalar = "foo";
      $class  = blessed $scalar;           # undef
  
      $ref    = [];
      $class  = blessed $ref;              # undef
  
      $obj    = bless [], "Foo";
      $class  = blessed $obj;              # "Foo"
  
  Take care when using this function simply as a truth test (such as in
  C<if(blessed $ref)...>) because the package name C<"0"> is defined yet false.
  
  =head2 refaddr
  
      my $addr = refaddr( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is reference, the internal memory address of the referenced value is
  returned as a plain integer. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $addr = refaddr "string";           # undef
      $addr = refaddr \$var;              # eg 12345678
      $addr = refaddr [];                 # eg 23456784
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $addr = refaddr $obj;               # eg 88123488
  
  =head2 reftype
  
      my $type = reftype( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a reference, the basic Perl type of the variable referenced is
  returned as a plain string (such as C<ARRAY> or C<HASH>). Otherwise C<undef>
  is returned.
  
      $type = reftype "string";           # undef
      $type = reftype \$var;              # SCALAR
      $type = reftype [];                 # ARRAY
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $type = reftype $obj;               # HASH
  
  =head2 weaken
  
      weaken( $ref );
  
  The lvalue C<$ref> will be turned into a weak reference. This means that it
  will not hold a reference count on the object it references. Also, when the
  reference count on that object reaches zero, the reference will be set to
  undef. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its argument and returns no
  value.
  
  This is useful for keeping copies of references, but you don't want to prevent
  the object being DESTROY-ed at its usual time.
  
      {
        my $var;
        $ref = \$var;
        weaken($ref);                     # Make $ref a weak reference
      }
      # $ref is now undef
  
  Note that if you take a copy of a scalar with a weakened reference, the copy
  will be a strong reference.
  
      my $var;
      my $foo = \$var;
      weaken($foo);                       # Make $foo a weak reference
      my $bar = $foo;                     # $bar is now a strong reference
  
  This may be less obvious in other situations, such as C<grep()>, for instance
  when grepping through a list of weakened references to objects that may have
  been destroyed already:
  
      @object = grep { defined } @object;
  
  This will indeed remove all references to destroyed objects, but the remaining
  references to objects will be strong, causing the remaining objects to never be
  destroyed because there is now always a strong reference to them in the @object
  array.
  
  =head2 unweaken
  
      unweaken( $ref );
  
  I<Since version 1.36.>
  
  The lvalue C<REF> will be turned from a weak reference back into a normal
  (strong) reference again. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its
  argument and returns no value. This undoes the action performed by
  L</weaken>.
  
  This function is slightly neater and more convenient than the
  otherwise-equivalent code
  
      my $tmp = $REF;
      undef $REF;
      $REF = $tmp;
  
  (because in particular, simply assigning a weak reference back to itself does
  not work to unweaken it; C<$REF = $REF> does not work).
  
  =head2 isweak
  
      my $weak = isweak( $ref );
  
  Returns true if C<$ref> is a weak reference.
  
      $ref  = \$foo;
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # false
      weaken($ref);
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # true
  
  B<NOTE>: Copying a weak reference creates a normal, strong, reference.
  
      $copy = $ref;
      $weak = isweak($copy);              # false
  
  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 dualvar
  
      my $var = dualvar( $num, $string );
  
  Returns a scalar that has the value C<$num> in a numeric context and the value
  C<$string> in a string context.
  
      $foo = dualvar 10, "Hello";
      $num = $foo + 2;                    # 12
      $str = $foo . " world";             # Hello world
  
  =head2 isdual
  
      my $dual = isdual( $var );
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar that has both numeric and string values, the result is
  true.
  
      $foo = dualvar 86, "Nix";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that a scalar can be made to have both string and numeric content through
  numeric operations:
  
      $foo = "10";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # false
      $bar = $foo + 0;
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that although C<$!> appears to be a dual-valued variable, it is
  actually implemented as a magical variable inside the interpreter:
  
      $! = 1;
      print("$!\n");                      # "Operation not permitted"
      $dual = isdual($!);                 # false
  
  You can capture its numeric and string content using:
  
      $err = dualvar $!, $!;
      $dual = isdual($err);               # true
  
  =head2 isvstring
  
      my $vstring = isvstring( $var );
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar which was coded as a vstring, the result is true.
  
      $vs   = v49.46.48;
      $fmt  = isvstring($vs) ? "%vd" : "%s"; #true
      printf($fmt,$vs);
  
  =head2 looks_like_number
  
      my $isnum = looks_like_number( $var );
  
  Returns true if perl thinks C<$var> is a number. See
  L<perlapi/looks_like_number>.
  
  =head2 openhandle
  
      my $fh = openhandle( $fh );
  
  Returns C<$fh> itself if C<$fh> may be used as a filehandle and is open, or is
  is a tied handle. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $fh = openhandle(*STDIN);           # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(\*STDIN);          # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(*NOTOPEN);         # undef
      $fh = openhandle("scalar");         # undef
  
  =head2 readonly
  
      my $ro = readonly( $var );
  
  Returns true if C<$var> is readonly.
  
      sub foo { readonly($_[0]) }
  
      $readonly = foo($bar);              # false
      $readonly = foo(0);                 # true
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype( $code, $prototype );
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
      set_prototype \&foo, '$$';
  
  =head2 tainted
  
      my $t = tainted( $var );
  
  Return true if C<$var> is tainted.
  
      $taint = tainted("constant");       # false
      $taint = tainted($ENV{PWD});        # true if running under -T

  Sub::Util - A selection of utility subroutines for subs and CODE references
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Sub::Util qw( prototype set_prototype subname set_subname );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Sub::Util> contains a selection of utility subroutines that are useful for
  operating on subs and CODE references.
  
  The rationale for inclusion in this module is that the function performs some
  work for which an XS implementation is essential because it cannot be
  implemented in Pure Perl, and which is sufficiently-widely used across CPAN
  that its popularity warrants inclusion in a core module, which this is.

  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 prototype
  
      my $proto = prototype( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the prototype of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one, as a
  string. This is the same as the C<CORE::prototype> operator; it is included
  here simply for symmetry and completeness with the other functions.
  
  =cut
  
  sub prototype
  {
    my ( $code ) = @_;
    return CORE::prototype( $code );
  }
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype $prototype, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
  I<Caution>: This function takes arguments in a different order to the previous
  copy of the code from C<Scalar::Util>. This is to match the order of
  C<set_subname>, and other potential additions in this file. This order has
  been chosen as it allows a neat and simple chaining of other
  C<Sub::Util::set_*> functions as might become available, such as:
  
   my $code =
      set_subname   name_here =>
      set_prototype '&@'      =>
      set_attribute ':lvalue' =>
         sub { ...... };
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 subname
  
      my $name = subname( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the name of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one. Normal named
  subs will give a fully-qualified name consisting of the package and the
  localname separated by C<::>. Anonymous code references will give C<__ANON__>
  as the localname. If a name has been set using L</set_subname>, this name will
  be returned instead.
  
  This function was inspired by C<sub_fullname> from L<Sub::Identify>. The
  remaining functions that C<Sub::Identify> implements can easily be emulated
  using regexp operations, such as
  
   sub get_code_info { return (subname $_[0]) =~ m/^(.+)::(.*?)$/ }
   sub sub_name      { return (get_code_info $_[0])[0] }
   sub stash_name    { return (get_code_info $_[0])[1] }
  
  I<Users of Sub::Name beware>: This function is B<not> the same as
  C<Sub::Name::subname>; it returns the existing name of the sub rather than
  changing it. To set or change a name, see instead L</set_subname>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 set_subname
  
      my $code = set_subname $name, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the name of the function given by the C<$code> reference. Returns the
  C<$code> reference itself. If the C<$name> is unqualified, the package of the
  caller is used to qualify it.
  
  This is useful for applying names to anonymous CODE references so that stack
  traces and similar situations, to give a useful name rather than having the
  default of C<__ANON__>. Note that this name is only used for this situation;
  the C<set_subname> will not install it into the symbol table; you will have to
  do that yourself if required.
  
  However, since the name is not used by perl except as the return value of
  C<caller>, for stack traces or similar, there is no actual requirement that
  the name be syntactically valid as a perl function name. This could be used to
  attach extra information that could be useful in debugging stack traces.
  
  This function was copied from C<Sub::Name::subname> and renamed to the naming
  convention of this module.
