  #pod This constructor returns a new HTTP::Tiny object.  Valid attributes include:
  #pod
  #pod =for :list
  #pod * C<agent> — A user-agent string (defaults to 'HTTP-Tiny/$VERSION'). If
  #pod   C<agent> — ends in a space character, the default user-agent string is
  #pod   appended.
  #pod * C<cookie_jar> — An instance of L<HTTP::CookieJar> — or equivalent class
  #pod   that supports the C<add> and C<cookie_header> methods
  #pod * C<default_headers> — A hashref of default headers to apply to requests
  #pod * C<local_address> — The local IP address to bind to
  #pod * C<keep_alive> — Whether to reuse the last connection (if for the same
  #pod   scheme, host and port) (defaults to 1)
  #pod * C<max_redirect> — Maximum number of redirects allowed (defaults to 5)
  #pod * C<max_size> — Maximum response size in bytes (only when not using a data
  #pod   callback).  If defined, responses larger than this will return an
  #pod   exception.
  #pod * C<http_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTP connections
  #pod   (default is C<$ENV{http_proxy}> — if set)
  #pod * C<https_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTPS connections
  #pod   (default is C<$ENV{https_proxy}> — if set)
  #pod * C<proxy> — URL of a generic proxy server for both HTTP and HTTPS
  #pod   connections (default is C<$ENV{all_proxy}> — if set)
  #pod * C<no_proxy> — List of domain suffixes that should not be proxied.  Must
  #pod   be a comma-separated string or an array reference. (default is
  #pod   C<$ENV{no_proxy}> —)
  #pod * C<timeout> — Request timeout in seconds (default is 60) If a socket open,
  #pod   read or write takes longer than the timeout, an exception is thrown.
  #pod * C<verify_SSL> — A boolean that indicates whether to validate the SSL
  #pod   certificate of an C<https> — connection (default is false)
  #pod * C<SSL_options> — A hashref of C<SSL_*> — options to pass through to
  #pod   L<IO::Socket::SSL>
  #pod
  #pod Passing an explicit C<undef> for C<proxy>, C<http_proxy> or C<https_proxy> will
  #pod prevent getting the corresponding proxies from the environment.
  #pod
  #pod Exceptions from C<max_size>, C<timeout> or other errors will result in a
  #pod pseudo-HTTP status code of 599 and a reason of "Internal Exception". The
  #pod content field in the response will contain the text of the exception.
  #pod
  #pod The C<keep_alive> parameter enables a persistent connection, but only to a
  #pod single destination scheme, host and port.  Also, if any connection-relevant
  #pod attributes are modified, or if the process ID or thread ID change, the
  #pod persistent connection will be dropped.  If you want persistent connections
  #pod across multiple destinations, use multiple HTTP::Tiny objects.

  #pod
  #pod Executes an HTTP request of the given method type ('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST',
  #pod 'PUT', etc.) on the given URL.  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and
  #pod international domain names encoded.
  #pod
  #pod If the URL includes a "user:password" stanza, they will be used for Basic-style
  #pod authorization headers.  (Authorization headers will not be included in a
  #pod redirected request.) For example:
  #pod
  #pod     $http->request('GET', 'http://Aladdin:open sesame@example.com/');
  #pod
  #pod If the "user:password" stanza contains reserved characters, they must
  #pod be percent-escaped:
  #pod
  #pod     $http->request('GET', 'http://john%40example.com:password@example.com/');
  #pod
  #pod A hashref of options may be appended to modify the request.
  #pod
  #pod Valid options are:
  #pod
  #pod =for :list
  #pod * C<headers> —
  #pod     A hashref containing headers to include with the request.  If the value for
  #pod     a header is an array reference, the header will be output multiple times with
  #pod     each value in the array.  These headers over-write any default headers.
  #pod * C<content> —
  #pod     A scalar to include as the body of the request OR a code reference
  #pod     that will be called iteratively to produce the body of the request
  #pod * C<trailer_callback> —
  #pod     A code reference that will be called if it exists to provide a hashref
  #pod     of trailing headers (only used with chunked transfer-encoding)
  #pod * C<data_callback> —
  #pod     A code reference that will be called for each chunks of the response
  #pod     body received.
  #pod * C<peer> —
  #pod     Override host resolution and force all connections to go only to a
  #pod     specific peer address, regardless of the URL of the request.  This will
  #pod     include any redirections!  This options should be used with extreme
  #pod     caution (e.g. debugging or very special circumstances).
  #pod
  #pod The C<Host> header is generated from the URL in accordance with RFC 2616.  It
  #pod is a fatal error to specify C<Host> in the C<headers> option.  Other headers
  #pod may be ignored or overwritten if necessary for transport compliance.
  #pod
  #pod If the C<content> option is a code reference, it will be called iteratively
  #pod to provide the content body of the request.  It should return the empty
  #pod string or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
  #pod
  #pod If the C<content> option is the empty string, no C<content-type> or
  #pod C<content-length> headers will be generated.
  #pod
  #pod If the C<data_callback> option is provided, it will be called iteratively until
  #pod the entire response body is received.  The first argument will be a string
  #pod containing a chunk of the response body, the second argument will be the
  #pod in-progress response hash reference, as described below.  (This allows
  #pod customizing the action of the callback based on the C<status> or C<headers>
  #pod received prior to the content body.)
  #pod
  #pod The C<request> method returns a hashref containing the response.  The hashref
  #pod will have the following keys:
  #pod
  #pod =for :list
  #pod * C<success> —
  #pod     Boolean indicating whether the operation returned a 2XX status code
  #pod * C<url> —
  #pod     URL that provided the response. This is the URL of the request unless
  #pod     there were redirections, in which case it is the last URL queried
  #pod     in a redirection chain
  #pod * C<status> —
  #pod     The HTTP status code of the response
  #pod * C<reason> —
  #pod     The response phrase returned by the server
  #pod * C<content> —
  #pod     The body of the response.  If the response does not have any content
  #pod     or if a data callback is provided to consume the response body,
  #pod     this will be the empty string
  #pod * C<headers> —
  #pod     A hashref of header fields.  All header field names will be normalized
  #pod     to be lower case. If a header is repeated, the value will be an arrayref;
  #pod     it will otherwise be a scalar string containing the value
  #pod * C<redirects>
  #pod     If this field exists, it is an arrayref of response hash references from
  #pod     redirects in the same order that redirections occurred.  If it does
  #pod     not exist, then no redirections occurred.
  #pod
  #pod On an exception during the execution of the request, the C<status> field will
  #pod contain 599, and the C<content> field will contain the text of the exception.

  =head1 NAME
  
  HTTP::Tiny - A small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.070
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use HTTP::Tiny;
  
      my $response = HTTP::Tiny->new->get('http://example.com/');
  
      die "Failed!\n" unless $response->{success};
  
      print "$response->{status} $response->{reason}\n";
  
      while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$response->{headers}}) {
          for (ref $v eq 'ARRAY' ? @$v : $v) {
              print "$k: $_\n";
          }
      }
  
      print $response->{content} if length $response->{content};
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple
  requests without the overhead of a large framework like L<LWP::UserAgent>.
  
  It is more correct and more complete than L<HTTP::Lite>.  It supports
  proxies and redirection.  It also correctly resumes after EINTR.
  
  If L<IO::Socket::IP> 0.25 or later is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it instead
  of L<IO::Socket::INET> for transparent support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
  
  Cookie support requires L<HTTP::CookieJar> or an equivalent class.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
      $http = HTTP::Tiny->new( %attributes );
  
  This constructor returns a new HTTP::Tiny object.  Valid attributes include:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<agent> — A user-agent string (defaults to 'HTTP-Tiny/$VERSION'). If C<agent> — ends in a space character, the default user-agent string is appended.
  
  =item *
  
  C<cookie_jar> — An instance of L<HTTP::CookieJar> — or equivalent class that supports the C<add> and C<cookie_header> methods
  
  =item *
  
  C<default_headers> — A hashref of default headers to apply to requests
  
  =item *
  
  C<local_address> — The local IP address to bind to
  
  =item *
  
  C<keep_alive> — Whether to reuse the last connection (if for the same scheme, host and port) (defaults to 1)
  
  =item *
  
  C<max_redirect> — Maximum number of redirects allowed (defaults to 5)
  
  =item *
  
  C<max_size> — Maximum response size in bytes (only when not using a data callback).  If defined, responses larger than this will return an exception.
  
  =item *
  
  C<http_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTP connections (default is C<$ENV{http_proxy}> — if set)
  
  =item *
  
  C<https_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTPS connections (default is C<$ENV{https_proxy}> — if set)
  
  =item *
  
  C<proxy> — URL of a generic proxy server for both HTTP and HTTPS connections (default is C<$ENV{all_proxy}> — if set)
  
  =item *
  
  C<no_proxy> — List of domain suffixes that should not be proxied.  Must be a comma-separated string or an array reference. (default is C<$ENV{no_proxy}> —)
  
  =item *
  
  C<timeout> — Request timeout in seconds (default is 60) If a socket open, read or write takes longer than the timeout, an exception is thrown.
  
  =item *
  
  C<verify_SSL> — A boolean that indicates whether to validate the SSL certificate of an C<https> — connection (default is false)
  
  =item *
  
  C<SSL_options> — A hashref of C<SSL_*> — options to pass through to L<IO::Socket::SSL>
  
  =back
  
  Passing an explicit C<undef> for C<proxy>, C<http_proxy> or C<https_proxy> will
  prevent getting the corresponding proxies from the environment.
  
  Exceptions from C<max_size>, C<timeout> or other errors will result in a
  pseudo-HTTP status code of 599 and a reason of "Internal Exception". The
  content field in the response will contain the text of the exception.
  
  The C<keep_alive> parameter enables a persistent connection, but only to a
  single destination scheme, host and port.  Also, if any connection-relevant
  attributes are modified, or if the process ID or thread ID change, the
  persistent connection will be dropped.  If you want persistent connections
  across multiple destinations, use multiple HTTP::Tiny objects.
  
  See L</SSL SUPPORT> for more on the C<verify_SSL> and C<SSL_options> attributes.
  
  =head2 get|head|put|post|delete
  
      $response = $http->get($url);
      $response = $http->get($url, \%options);
      $response = $http->head($url);
  
  These methods are shorthand for calling C<request()> for the given method.  The
  URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain names encoded.
  See C<request()> for valid options and a description of the response.
  
  The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX.
  
  =head2 post_form
  
      $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data);
      $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data, \%options);
  
  This method executes a C<POST> request and sends the key/value pairs from a
  form data hash or array reference to the given URL with a C<content-type> of
  C<application/x-www-form-urlencoded>.  If data is provided as an array
  reference, the order is preserved; if provided as a hash reference, the terms
  are sorted on key and value for consistency.  See documentation for the
  C<www_form_urlencode> method for details on the encoding.
  
  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain names
  encoded.  See C<request()> for valid options and a description of the response.
  Any C<content-type> header or content in the options hashref will be ignored.
  
  The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX.
  
  =head2 mirror
  
      $response = $http->mirror($url, $file, \%options)
      if ( $response->{success} ) {
          print "$file is up to date\n";
      }
  
  Executes a C<GET> request for the URL and saves the response body to the file
  name provided.  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international
  domain names encoded.  If the file already exists, the request will include an
  C<If-Modified-Since> header with the modification timestamp of the file.  You
  may specify a different C<If-Modified-Since> header yourself in the C<<
  $options->{headers} >> hash.
  
  The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX
  or if the status code is 304 (unmodified).
  
  If the file was modified and the server response includes a properly
  formatted C<Last-Modified> header, the file modification time will
  be updated accordingly.
  
  =head2 request
  
      $response = $http->request($method, $url);
      $response = $http->request($method, $url, \%options);
  
  Executes an HTTP request of the given method type ('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST',
  'PUT', etc.) on the given URL.  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and
  international domain names encoded.
  
  If the URL includes a "user:password" stanza, they will be used for Basic-style
  authorization headers.  (Authorization headers will not be included in a
  redirected request.) For example:
  
      $http->request('GET', 'http://Aladdin:open sesame@example.com/');
  
  If the "user:password" stanza contains reserved characters, they must
  be percent-escaped:
  
      $http->request('GET', 'http://john%40example.com:password@example.com/');
  
  A hashref of options may be appended to modify the request.
  
  Valid options are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<headers> — A hashref containing headers to include with the request.  If the value for a header is an array reference, the header will be output multiple times with each value in the array.  These headers over-write any default headers.
  
  =item *
  
  C<content> — A scalar to include as the body of the request OR a code reference that will be called iteratively to produce the body of the request
  
  =item *
  
  C<trailer_callback> — A code reference that will be called if it exists to provide a hashref of trailing headers (only used with chunked transfer-encoding)
  
  =item *
  
  C<data_callback> — A code reference that will be called for each chunks of the response body received.
  
  =item *
  
  C<peer> — Override host resolution and force all connections to go only to a specific peer address, regardless of the URL of the request.  This will include any redirections!  This options should be used with extreme caution (e.g. debugging or very special circumstances).
  
  =back
  
  The C<Host> header is generated from the URL in accordance with RFC 2616.  It
  is a fatal error to specify C<Host> in the C<headers> option.  Other headers
  may be ignored or overwritten if necessary for transport compliance.
  
  If the C<content> option is a code reference, it will be called iteratively
  to provide the content body of the request.  It should return the empty
  string or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
  
  If the C<content> option is the empty string, no C<content-type> or
  C<content-length> headers will be generated.
  
  If the C<data_callback> option is provided, it will be called iteratively until
  the entire response body is received.  The first argument will be a string
  containing a chunk of the response body, the second argument will be the
  in-progress response hash reference, as described below.  (This allows
  customizing the action of the callback based on the C<status> or C<headers>
  received prior to the content body.)
  
  The C<request> method returns a hashref containing the response.  The hashref
  will have the following keys:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<success> — Boolean indicating whether the operation returned a 2XX status code
  
  =item *
  
  C<url> — URL that provided the response. This is the URL of the request unless there were redirections, in which case it is the last URL queried in a redirection chain
  
  =item *
  
  C<status> — The HTTP status code of the response
  
  =item *
  
  C<reason> — The response phrase returned by the server
  
  =item *
  
  C<content> — The body of the response.  If the response does not have any content or if a data callback is provided to consume the response body, this will be the empty string
  
  =item *
  
  C<headers> — A hashref of header fields.  All header field names will be normalized to be lower case. If a header is repeated, the value will be an arrayref; it will otherwise be a scalar string containing the value
  
  =item *
  
  C<redirects> If this field exists, it is an arrayref of response hash references from redirects in the same order that redirections occurred.  If it does not exist, then no redirections occurred.
  
  =back
  
  On an exception during the execution of the request, the C<status> field will
  contain 599, and the C<content> field will contain the text of the exception.
  
  =head2 www_form_urlencode
  
      $params = $http->www_form_urlencode( $data );
      $response = $http->get("http://example.com/query?$params");
  
  This method converts the key/value pairs from a data hash or array reference
  into a C<x-www-form-urlencoded> string.  The keys and values from the data
  reference will be UTF-8 encoded and escaped per RFC 3986.  If a value is an
  array reference, the key will be repeated with each of the values of the array
  reference.  If data is provided as a hash reference, the key/value pairs in the
  resulting string will be sorted by key and value for consistent ordering.
  
  =head2 can_ssl
  
      $ok         = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
      ($ok, $why) = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
      ($ok, $why) = $http->can_ssl;
  
  Indicates if SSL support is available.  When called as a class object, it
  checks for the correct version of L<Net::SSLeay> and L<IO::Socket::SSL>.
  When called as an object methods, if C<SSL_verify> is true or if C<SSL_verify_mode>
  is set in C<SSL_options>, it checks that a CA file is available.
  
  In scalar context, returns a boolean indicating if SSL is available.
  In list context, returns the boolean and a (possibly multi-line) string of
  errors indicating why SSL isn't available.
  
  =head2 connected
  
      $host = $http->connected;
      ($host, $port) = $http->connected;
  
  Indicates if a connection to a peer is being kept alive, per the C<keep_alive>
  option.
  
  In scalar context, returns the peer host and port, joined with a colon, or
  C<undef> (if no peer is connected).
  In list context, returns the peer host and port or an empty list (if no peer
  is connected).
  
  B<Note>: This method cannot reliably be used to discover whether the remote
  host has closed its end of the socket.

  =head1 SSL SUPPORT
  
  Direct C<https> connections are supported only if L<IO::Socket::SSL> 1.56 or
  greater and L<Net::SSLeay> 1.49 or greater are installed. An exception will be
  thrown if new enough versions of these modules are not installed or if the SSL
  encryption fails. You can also use C<HTTP::Tiny::can_ssl()> utility function
  that returns boolean to see if the required modules are installed.
  
  An C<https> connection may be made via an C<http> proxy that supports the CONNECT
  command (i.e. RFC 2817).  You may not proxy C<https> via a proxy that itself
  requires C<https> to communicate.
  
  SSL provides two distinct capabilities:

  =item *
  
  Encrypted communication channel
  
  =item *
  
  Verification of server identity
  
  =back
  
  B<By default, HTTP::Tiny does not verify server identity>.
  
  Server identity verification is controversial and potentially tricky because it
  depends on a (usually paid) third-party Certificate Authority (CA) trust model
  to validate a certificate as legitimate.  This discriminates against servers
  with self-signed certificates or certificates signed by free, community-driven
  CA's such as L<CAcert.org|http://cacert.org>.
  
  By default, HTTP::Tiny does not make any assumptions about your trust model,
  threat level or risk tolerance.  It just aims to give you an encrypted channel
  when you need one.
  
  Setting the C<verify_SSL> attribute to a true value will make HTTP::Tiny verify
  that an SSL connection has a valid SSL certificate corresponding to the host
  name of the connection and that the SSL certificate has been verified by a CA.
  Assuming you trust the CA, this will protect against a L<man-in-the-middle
  attack|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>.  If you are
  concerned about security, you should enable this option.
  
  Certificate verification requires a file containing trusted CA certificates.
  
  If the environment variable C<SSL_CERT_FILE> is present, HTTP::Tiny
  will try to find a CA certificate file in that location.
  
  If the L<Mozilla::CA> module is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use the CA file
  included with it as a source of trusted CA's.  (This means you trust Mozilla,
  the author of Mozilla::CA, the CPAN mirror where you got Mozilla::CA, the
  toolchain used to install it, and your operating system security, right?)
  
  If that module is not available, then HTTP::Tiny will search several
  system-specific default locations for a CA certificate file:
  
  =over 4

  An exception will be raised if C<verify_SSL> is true and no CA certificate file
  is available.
  
  If you desire complete control over SSL connections, the C<SSL_options> attribute
  lets you provide a hash reference that will be passed through to
  C<IO::Socket::SSL::start_SSL()>, overriding any options set by HTTP::Tiny. For
  example, to provide your own trusted CA file:
  
      SSL_options => {
          SSL_ca_file => $file_path,
      }
  
  The C<SSL_options> attribute could also be used for such things as providing a
  client certificate for authentication to a server or controlling the choice of
  cipher used for the SSL connection. See L<IO::Socket::SSL> documentation for
  details.
  
  =head1 PROXY SUPPORT
  
  HTTP::Tiny can proxy both C<http> and C<https> requests.  Only Basic proxy
  authorization is supported and it must be provided as part of the proxy URL:
  C<http://user:pass@proxy.example.com/>.
  
  HTTP::Tiny supports the following proxy environment variables:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY
  
  =item *
  
  https_proxy or HTTPS_PROXY
  
  =item *
  
  all_proxy or ALL_PROXY
  
  =back
  
  If the C<REQUEST_METHOD> environment variable is set, then this might be a CGI
  process and C<HTTP_PROXY> would be set from the C<Proxy:> header, which is a
  security risk.  If C<REQUEST_METHOD> is set, C<HTTP_PROXY> (the upper case
  variant only) is ignored.
  
  Tunnelling C<https> over an C<http> proxy using the CONNECT method is
  supported.  If your proxy uses C<https> itself, you can not tunnel C<https>
  over it.
  
  Be warned that proxying an C<https> connection opens you to the risk of a
  man-in-the-middle attack by the proxy server.
  
  The C<no_proxy> environment variable is supported in the format of a
  comma-separated list of domain extensions proxy should not be used for.
  
  Proxy arguments passed to C<new> will override their corresponding
  environment variables.
  
  =head1 LIMITATIONS
  
  HTTP::Tiny is I<conditionally compliant> with the
  L<HTTP/1.1 specifications|http://www.w3.org/Protocols/>:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  "Message Syntax and Routing" [RFC7230]
  
  =item *
  
  "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231]
  
  =item *
  
  "Conditional Requests" [RFC7232]
  
  =item *
  
  "Range Requests" [RFC7233]
  
  =item *
  
  "Caching" [RFC7234]
  
  =item *
  
  "Authentication" [RFC7235]
  
  =back
  
  It attempts to meet all "MUST" requirements of the specification, but does not
  implement all "SHOULD" requirements.  (Note: it was developed against the
  earlier RFC 2616 specification and may not yet meet the revised RFC 7230-7235
  spec.)
  
  Some particular limitations of note include:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  HTTP::Tiny focuses on correct transport.  Users are responsible for ensuring
  that user-defined headers and content are compliant with the HTTP/1.1
  specification.
  
  =item *
  
  Users must ensure that URLs are properly escaped for unsafe characters and that
  international domain names are properly encoded to ASCII. See L<URI::Escape>,
  L<URI::_punycode> and L<Net::IDN::Encode>.
  
  =item *
  
  Redirection is very strict against the specification.  Redirection is only
  automatic for response codes 301, 302, 307 and 308 if the request method is
  'GET' or 'HEAD'.  Response code 303 is always converted into a 'GET'
  redirection, as mandated by the specification.  There is no automatic support
  for status 305 ("Use proxy") redirections.
  
  =item *
  
  There is no provision for delaying a request body using an C<Expect> header.
  Unexpected C<1XX> responses are silently ignored as per the specification.
  
  =item *
  
  Only 'chunked' C<Transfer-Encoding> is supported.
  
  =item *
  
  There is no support for a Request-URI of '*' for the 'OPTIONS' request.
  
  =item *
  
  Headers mentioned in the RFCs and some other, well-known headers are
  generated with their canonical case.  Other headers are sent in the
  case provided by the user.  Except for control headers (which are sent first),
  headers are sent in arbitrary order.
  
  =back
  
  Despite the limitations listed above, HTTP::Tiny is considered
  feature-complete.  New feature requests should be directed to
  L<HTTP::Tiny::UA>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  C<IO::Socket::IP> - Family-neutral IP socket supporting both IPv4 and IPv6
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   use IO::Socket::IP;
  
   my $sock = IO::Socket::IP->new(
      PeerHost => "www.google.com",
      PeerPort => "http",
      Type     => SOCK_STREAM,
   ) or die "Cannot construct socket - $@";
  
   my $familyname = ( $sock->sockdomain == PF_INET6 ) ? "IPv6" :
                    ( $sock->sockdomain == PF_INET  ) ? "IPv4" :
                                                        "unknown";
  
   printf "Connected to google via %s\n", $familyname;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides a protocol-independent way to use IPv4 and IPv6 sockets,
  intended as a replacement for L<IO::Socket::INET>. Most constructor arguments
  and methods are provided in a backward-compatible way. For a list of known
  differences, see the C<IO::Socket::INET> INCOMPATIBILITES section below.
  
  It uses the C<getaddrinfo(3)> function to convert hostnames and service names
  or port numbers into sets of possible addresses to connect to or listen on.
  This allows it to work for IPv6 where the system supports it, while still
  falling back to IPv4-only on systems which don't.
  
  =head1 REPLACING C<IO::Socket> DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR
  
  By placing C<-register> in the import list, L<IO::Socket> uses
  C<IO::Socket::IP> rather than C<IO::Socket::INET> as the class that handles
  C<PF_INET>.  C<IO::Socket> will also use C<IO::Socket::IP> rather than
  C<IO::Socket::INET6> to handle C<PF_INET6>, provided that the C<AF_INET6>
  constant is available.
  
  Changing C<IO::Socket>'s default behaviour means that calling the
  C<IO::Socket> constructor with either C<PF_INET> or C<PF_INET6> as the
  C<Domain> parameter will yield an C<IO::Socket::IP> object.
  
   use IO::Socket::IP -register;
  
   my $sock = IO::Socket->new(
      Domain    => PF_INET6,
      LocalHost => "::1",
      Listen    => 1,
   ) or die "Cannot create socket - $@\n";
  
   print "Created a socket of type " . ref($sock) . "\n";
  
  Note that C<-register> is a global setting that applies to the entire program;
  it cannot be applied only for certain callers, removed, or limited by lexical
  scope.

  =head1 CONSTRUCTORS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 $sock = IO::Socket::IP->new( %args )
  
  Creates a new C<IO::Socket::IP> object, containing a newly created socket
  handle according to the named arguments passed. The recognised arguments are:
  
  =over 8
  
  =item PeerHost => STRING
  
  =item PeerService => STRING
  
  Hostname and service name for the peer to C<connect()> to. The service name
  may be given as a port number, as a decimal string.
  
  =item PeerAddr => STRING
  
  =item PeerPort => STRING
  
  For symmetry with the accessor methods and compatibility with
  C<IO::Socket::INET>, these are accepted as synonyms for C<PeerHost> and
  C<PeerService> respectively.
  
  =item PeerAddrInfo => ARRAY
  
  Alternate form of specifying the peer to C<connect()> to. This should be an
  array of the form returned by C<Socket::getaddrinfo>.
  
  This parameter takes precedence over the C<Peer*>, C<Family>, C<Type> and
  C<Proto> arguments.
  
  =item LocalHost => STRING
  
  =item LocalService => STRING
  
  Hostname and service name for the local address to C<bind()> to.
  
  =item LocalAddr => STRING
  
  =item LocalPort => STRING
  
  For symmetry with the accessor methods and compatibility with
  C<IO::Socket::INET>, these are accepted as synonyms for C<LocalHost> and
  C<LocalService> respectively.
  
  =item LocalAddrInfo => ARRAY
  
  Alternate form of specifying the local address to C<bind()> to. This should be
  an array of the form returned by C<Socket::getaddrinfo>.
  
  This parameter takes precedence over the C<Local*>, C<Family>, C<Type> and
  C<Proto> arguments.
  
  =item Family => INT
  
  The address family to pass to C<getaddrinfo> (e.g. C<AF_INET>, C<AF_INET6>).
  Normally this will be left undefined, and C<getaddrinfo> will search using any
  address family supported by the system.
  
  =item Type => INT
  
  The socket type to pass to C<getaddrinfo> (e.g. C<SOCK_STREAM>,
  C<SOCK_DGRAM>). Normally defined by the caller; if left undefined
  C<getaddrinfo> may attempt to infer the type from the service name.
  
  =item Proto => STRING or INT
  
  The IP protocol to use for the socket (e.g. C<'tcp'>, C<IPPROTO_TCP>,
  C<'udp'>,C<IPPROTO_UDP>). Normally this will be left undefined, and either
  C<getaddrinfo> or the kernel will choose an appropriate value. May be given
  either in string name or numeric form.
  
  =item GetAddrInfoFlags => INT
  
  More flags to pass to the C<getaddrinfo()> function. If not supplied, a
  default of C<AI_ADDRCONFIG> will be used.
  
  These flags will be combined with C<AI_PASSIVE> if the C<Listen> argument is
  given. For more information see the documentation about C<getaddrinfo()> in
  the L<Socket> module.
  
  =item Listen => INT
  
  If defined, puts the socket into listening mode where new connections can be
  accepted using the C<accept> method. The value given is used as the
  C<listen(2)> queue size.
  
  =item ReuseAddr => BOOL
  
  If true, set the C<SO_REUSEADDR> sockopt
  
  =item ReusePort => BOOL
  
  If true, set the C<SO_REUSEPORT> sockopt (not all OSes implement this sockopt)
  
  =item Broadcast => BOOL
  
  If true, set the C<SO_BROADCAST> sockopt
  
  =item Sockopts => ARRAY
  
  An optional array of other socket options to apply after the three listed
  above. The value is an ARRAY containing 2- or 3-element ARRAYrefs. Each inner
  array relates to a single option, giving the level and option name, and an
  optional value. If the value element is missing, it will be given the value of
  a platform-sized integer 1 constant (i.e. suitable to enable most of the
  common boolean options).
  
  For example, both options given below are equivalent to setting C<ReuseAddr>.
  
   Sockopts => [
      [ SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR ],
      [ SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, pack( "i", 1 ) ],
   ]
  
  =item V6Only => BOOL
  
  If defined, set the C<IPV6_V6ONLY> sockopt when creating C<PF_INET6> sockets
  to the given value. If true, a listening-mode socket will only listen on the
  C<AF_INET6> addresses; if false it will also accept connections from
  C<AF_INET> addresses.
  
  If not defined, the socket option will not be changed, and default value set
  by the operating system will apply. For repeatable behaviour across platforms
  it is recommended this value always be defined for listening-mode sockets.
  
  Note that not all platforms support disabling this option. Some, at least
  OpenBSD and MirBSD, will fail with C<EINVAL> if you attempt to disable it.
  To determine whether it is possible to disable, you may use the class method
  
   if( IO::Socket::IP->CAN_DISABLE_V6ONLY ) {
      ...
   }
   else {
      ...
   }
  
  If your platform does not support disabling this option but you still want to
  listen for both C<AF_INET> and C<AF_INET6> connections you will have to create
  two listening sockets, one bound to each protocol.
  
  =item MultiHomed
  
  This C<IO::Socket::INET>-style argument is ignored, except if it is defined
  but false. See the C<IO::Socket::INET> INCOMPATIBILITES section below.
  
  However, the behaviour it enables is always performed by C<IO::Socket::IP>.
  
  =item Blocking => BOOL
  
  If defined but false, the socket will be set to non-blocking mode. Otherwise
  it will default to blocking mode. See the NON-BLOCKING section below for more
  detail.
  
  =item Timeout => NUM
  
  If defined, gives a maximum time in seconds to block per C<connect()> call
  when in blocking mode. If missing, no timeout is applied other than that
  provided by the underlying operating system. When in non-blocking mode this
  parameter is ignored.
  
  Note that if the hostname resolves to multiple address candidates, the same
  timeout will apply to each connection attempt individually, rather than to the
  operation as a whole. Further note that the timeout does not apply to the
  initial hostname resolve operation, if connecting by hostname.
  
  This behviour is copied inspired by C<IO::Socket::INET>; for more fine grained
  control over connection timeouts, consider performing a nonblocking connect
  directly.
  
  =back
  
  If neither C<Type> nor C<Proto> hints are provided, a default of
  C<SOCK_STREAM> and C<IPPROTO_TCP> respectively will be set, to maintain
  compatibility with C<IO::Socket::INET>. Other named arguments that are not
  recognised are ignored.
  
  If neither C<Family> nor any hosts or addresses are passed, nor any
  C<*AddrInfo>, then the constructor has no information on which to decide a
  socket family to create. In this case, it performs a C<getaddinfo> call with
  the C<AI_ADDRCONFIG> flag, no host name, and a service name of C<"0">, and
  uses the family of the first returned result.
  
  If the constructor fails, it will set C<$@> to an appropriate error message;
  this may be from C<$!> or it may be some other string; not every failure
  necessarily has an associated C<errno> value.
  
  =head2 $sock = IO::Socket::IP->new( $peeraddr )

  Returns the hostname and service name of the local address (that is, the

  If C<$numeric> is true, these will be given in numeric form rather than being
  resolved into names.
  
  The following four convenience wrappers may be used to obtain one of the two
  values returned here. If both host and service names are required, this method
  is preferable to the following wrappers, because it will call
  C<getnameinfo(3)> only once.

  Returns a new L<IO::Socket::INET> instance wrapping the same filehandle. This
  may be useful in cases where it is required, for backward-compatibility, to
  have a real object of C<IO::Socket::INET> type instead of C<IO::Socket::IP>.
  The new object will wrap the same underlying socket filehandle as the
  original, so care should be taken not to continue to use both objects
  concurrently. Ideally the original C<$sock> should be discarded after this
  method is called.
  
  This method checks that the socket domain is C<PF_INET> and will throw an
  exception if it isn't.

     my $self = shift;

     return IO::Socket::INET->new_from_fd( $self->fileno, "r+" );
  }
  
  =head1 NON-BLOCKING
  
  If the constructor is passed a defined but false value for the C<Blocking>
  argument then the socket is put into non-blocking mode. When in non-blocking
  mode, the socket will not be set up by the time the constructor returns,
  because the underlying C<connect(2)> syscall would otherwise have to block.
  
  The non-blocking behaviour is an extension of the C<IO::Socket::INET> API,
  unique to C<IO::Socket::IP>, because the former does not support multi-homed
  non-blocking connect.
  
  When using non-blocking mode, the caller must repeatedly check for
  writeability on the filehandle (for instance using C<select> or C<IO::Poll>).
  Each time the filehandle is ready to write, the C<connect> method must be
  called, with no arguments. Note that some operating systems, most notably
  C<MSWin32> do not report a C<connect()> failure using write-ready; so you must
  also C<select()> for exceptional status.
  
  While C<connect> returns false, the value of C<$!> indicates whether it should
  be tried again (by being set to the value C<EINPROGRESS>, or C<EWOULDBLOCK> on
  MSWin32), or whether a permanent error has occurred (e.g. C<ECONNREFUSED>).
  
  Once the socket has been connected to the peer, C<connect> will return true
  and the socket will now be ready to use.
  
  Note that calls to the platform's underlying C<getaddrinfo(3)> function may
  block. If C<IO::Socket::IP> has to perform this lookup, the constructor will
  block even when in non-blocking mode.
  
  To avoid this blocking behaviour, the caller should pass in the result of such
  a lookup using the C<PeerAddrInfo> or C<LocalAddrInfo> arguments. This can be
  achieved by using L<Net::LibAsyncNS>, or the C<getaddrinfo(3)> function can be
  called in a child process.
  
   use IO::Socket::IP;
   use Errno qw( EINPROGRESS EWOULDBLOCK );
  
   my @peeraddrinfo = ... # Caller must obtain the getaddinfo result here
  
   my $socket = IO::Socket::IP->new(
      PeerAddrInfo => \@peeraddrinfo,
      Blocking     => 0,
   ) or die "Cannot construct socket - $@";
  
   while( !$socket->connect and ( $! == EINPROGRESS || $! == EWOULDBLOCK ) ) {
      my $wvec = '';
      vec( $wvec, fileno $socket, 1 ) = 1;
      my $evec = '';
      vec( $evec, fileno $socket, 1 ) = 1;
  
      select( undef, $wvec, $evec, undef ) or die "Cannot select - $!";
   }
  
   die "Cannot connect - $!" if $!;
  
   ...
  
  The example above uses C<select()>, but any similar mechanism should work
  analogously. C<IO::Socket::IP> takes care when creating new socket filehandles
  to preserve the actual file descriptor number, so such techniques as C<poll>
  or C<epoll> should be transparent to its reallocation of a different socket
  underneath, perhaps in order to switch protocol family between C<PF_INET> and
  C<PF_INET6>.
  
  For another example using C<IO::Poll> and C<Net::LibAsyncNS>, see the
  F<examples/nonblocking_libasyncns.pl> file in the module distribution.

  =head1 C<PeerHost> AND C<LocalHost> PARSING
  
  To support the C<IO::Socket::INET> API, the host and port information may be
  passed in a single string rather than as two separate arguments.
  
  If either C<LocalHost> or C<PeerHost> (or their C<...Addr> synonyms) have any
  of the following special forms then special parsing is applied.
  
  The value of the C<...Host> argument will be split to give both the hostname
  and port (or service name):
  
   hostname.example.org:http    # Host name
   192.0.2.1:80                 # IPv4 address
   [2001:db8::1]:80             # IPv6 address
  
  In each case, the port or service name (e.g. C<80>) is passed as the
  C<LocalService> or C<PeerService> argument.
  
  Either of C<LocalService> or C<PeerService> (or their C<...Port> synonyms) can
  be either a service name, a decimal number, or a string containing both a
  service name and number, in a form such as
  
   http(80)
  
  In this case, the name (C<http>) will be tried first, but if the resolver does
  not understand it then the port number (C<80>) will be used instead.
  
  If the C<...Host> argument is in this special form and the corresponding
  C<...Service> or C<...Port> argument is also defined, the one parsed from
  the C<...Host> argument will take precedence and the other will be ignored.
  
  =head2 ( $host, $port ) = IO::Socket::IP->split_addr( $addr )
  
  Utility method that provides the parsing functionality described above.
  Returns a 2-element list, containing either the split hostname and port
  description if it could be parsed, or the given address and C<undef> if it was
  not recognised.
  
   IO::Socket::IP->split_addr( "hostname:http" )
                                # ( "hostname",  "http" )
  
   IO::Socket::IP->split_addr( "192.0.2.1:80" )
                                # ( "192.0.2.1", "80"   )
  
   IO::Socket::IP->split_addr( "[2001:db8::1]:80" )
                                # ( "2001:db8::1", "80" )
  
   IO::Socket::IP->split_addr( "something.else" )
                                # ( "something.else", undef )

  {
     shift;
     my ( $addr ) = @_;
  
     local ( $1, $2 ); # Placate a taint-related bug; [perl #67962]
     if( $addr =~ m/\A\[($IPv6_re)\](?::([^\s:]*))?\z/ or
         $addr =~ m/\A([^\s:]*):([^\s:]*)\z/ ) {
        return ( $1, $2 ) if defined $2 and length $2;
        return ( $1, undef );
     }
  
     return ( $addr, undef );
  }
  
  =head2 $addr = IO::Socket::IP->join_addr( $host, $port )
  
  Utility method that performs the reverse of C<split_addr>, returning a string
  formed by joining the specified host address and port number. The host address
  will be wrapped in C<[]> brackets if required (because it is a raw IPv6
  numeric address).
  
  This can be especially useful when combined with the C<sockhost_service> or
  C<peerhost_service> methods.
  
   say "Connected to ", IO::Socket::IP->join_addr( $sock->peerhost_service );

  =head1 C<IO::Socket::INET> INCOMPATIBILITES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  The behaviour enabled by C<MultiHomed> is in fact implemented by
  C<IO::Socket::IP> as it is required to correctly support searching for a
  useable address from the results of the C<getaddrinfo(3)> call. The
  constructor will ignore the value of this argument, except if it is defined
  but false. An exception is thrown in this case, because that would request it
  disable the C<getaddrinfo(3)> search behaviour in the first place.
  
  =item *
  
  C<IO::Socket::IP> implements both the C<Blocking> and C<Timeout> parameters,
  but it implements the interaction of both in a different way.
  
  In C<::INET>, supplying a timeout overrides the non-blocking behaviour,
  meaning that the C<connect()> operation will still block despite that the
  caller asked for a non-blocking socket. This is not explicitly specified in
  its documentation, nor does this author believe that is a useful behaviour -
  it appears to come from a quirk of implementation.
  
  In C<::IP> therefore, the C<Blocking> parameter takes precedence - if a
  non-blocking socket is requested, no operation will block. The C<Timeout>
  parameter here simply defines the maximum time that a blocking C<connect()>
  call will wait, if it blocks at all.
  
  In order to specifically obtain the "blocking connect then non-blocking send
  and receive" behaviour of specifying this combination of options to C<::INET>
  when using C<::IP>, perform first a blocking connect, then afterwards turn the
  socket into nonblocking mode.
  
   my $sock = IO::Socket::IP->new(
      PeerHost => $peer,
      Timeout => 20,
   ) or die "Cannot connect - $@";
  
   $sock->blocking( 0 );
  
  This code will behave identically under both C<IO::Socket::INET> and
  C<IO::Socket::IP>.

  =head1 VERSION
  
      2.97001
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  JSON::PP is a pure perl JSON decoder/encoder (as of RFC4627, which
  we know is obsolete but we still stick to; see below for an option
  to support part of RFC7159), and (almost) compatible to much
  faster L<JSON::XS> written by Marc Lehmann in C. JSON::PP works as
  a fallback module when you use L<JSON> module without having
  installed JSON::XS.
  
  Because of this fallback feature of JSON.pm, JSON::PP tries not to
  be more JavaScript-friendly than JSON::XS (i.e. not to escape extra
  characters such as U+2028 and U+2029 nor support RFC7159/ECMA-404),
  in order for you not to lose such JavaScript-friendliness silently
  when you use JSON.pm and install JSON::XS for speed or by accident.
  If you need JavaScript-friendly RFC7159-compliant pure perl module,
  try L<JSON::Tiny>, which is derived from L<Mojolicious> web
  framework and is also smaller and faster than JSON::PP.
  
  JSON::PP has been in the Perl core since Perl 5.14, mainly for
  CPAN toolchain modules to parse META.json.
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  This section is taken from JSON::XS almost verbatim. C<encode_json>
  and C<decode_json> are exported by default.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string
  (that is, the string contains octets only). Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON::PP->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference. Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON::PP->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::PP::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::PP::true or
  JSON::PP::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  =head1 OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  This section is also taken from JSON::XS.
  
  The object oriented interface lets you configure your own encoding or
  decoding style, within the limits of supported formats.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON::PP->new
  
  Creates a new JSON::PP object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings. All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON::PP object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::PP->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  generate characters outside the code range C<0..127> (which is ASCII). Any
  Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either a
  single \uXXXX (BMP characters) or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence,
  as per RFC4627. The resulting encoded JSON text can be treated as a native
  Unicode string, an ascii-encoded, latin1-encoded or UTF-8 encoded string,
  or any other superset of ASCII.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results
  in a faster and more compact format.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this document.
  
  The main use for this flag is to produce JSON texts that can be
  transmitted over a 7-bit channel, as the encoded JSON texts will not
  contain any 8 bit characters.
  
    JSON::PP->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the resulting JSON text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters
  outside the code range C<0..255>. The resulting string can be treated as a
  latin1-encoded JSON text or a native Unicode string. The C<decode> method
  will not be affected in any way by this flag, as C<decode> by default
  expects Unicode, which is a strict superset of latin1.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this document.
  
  The main use for this flag is efficiently encoding binary data as JSON
  text, as most octets will not be escaped, resulting in a smaller encoded
  size. The disadvantage is that the resulting JSON text is encoded
  in latin1 (and must correctly be treated as such when storing and
  transferring), a rare encoding for JSON. It is therefore most useful when
  you want to store data structures known to contain binary data efficiently
  in files or databases, not when talking to other JSON encoders/decoders.
  
    JSON::PP->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the JSON result into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the
  C<decode> method expects to be handled an UTF-8-encoded string.  Please
  note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any characters outside the
  range C<0..255>, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O. In future
  versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16
  and UTF-32 encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will return the JSON
  string as a (non-encoded) Unicode string, while C<decode> expects thus a
  Unicode string.  Any decoding or encoding (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs
  to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this document.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::PP->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::PP->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> (and in the future possibly more) flags in one call to
  generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will use a multiline
  format as output, putting every array member or object/hash key-value pair
  into its own line, indenting them properly.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the
  resulting JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any C<newlines>.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  The default indent space length is three.
  You can use C<indent_length> to change the length.
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts. You will also
  most likely combine this setting with C<space_after>.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =item * C-style multiple-line '/* */'-comments (JSON::PP only)
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, C-style multiple-line comments are additionally
  allowed. Everything between C</*> and C<*/> is a comment, after which
  more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, /* this comment not allowed in JSON */
          /* neither this one... */
    ]
  
  =item * C++-style one-line '//'-comments (JSON::PP only)
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, C++-style one-line comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, // this comment not allowed in JSON
          // neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script, and can change even within the same run from 5.18
  onwards).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  This setting has currently no effect on tied hashes.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
  Example, encode a Perl scalar as JSON value with enabled C<allow_nonref>,
  resulting in an invalid JSON text:
  
     JSON::PP->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will I<not> throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON C<null> value. Note
  that blessed objects are not included here and are handled separately by
  c<allow_blessed>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect C<decode> in any way, and it is recommended to
  leave it off unless you know your communications partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference that it cannot convert
  otherwise. Instead, a JSON C<null> value is encoded instead of the object.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object that it cannot convert
  otherwise.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context and
  the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with any C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will not consider
  this type of conversion.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument is a reference to the
  newly-created hash. If the code references returns a single scalar (which
  need not be a reference), this value (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid
  aliasing) is inserted into the deserialised data structure. If it returns
  an empty list (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the
  original deserialised hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down
  decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::PP->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::PP
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), the string returned by C<encode> will
  be shrunk (i.e. downgraded if possible).
  
  The actual definition of what shrink does might change in future versions,
  but it will always try to save space at the expense of time.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then JSON::PP does nothing.
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  Setting the maximum depth to one disallows any nesting, so that ensures
  that the object is only a single hash/object or array.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl value or data structure to its JSON
  representation. Croaks on error.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
  This is useful if your JSON texts are not delimited by an outer protocol
  and you need to know where the JSON text ends.
  
     JSON::PP->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([1], 3)
  
  =head1 FLAGS FOR JSON::PP ONLY
  
  The following flags and properties are for JSON::PP only. If you use
  any of these, you can't make your application run faster by replacing
  JSON::PP with JSON::XS. If you need these and also speed boost,
  try L<Cpanel::JSON::XS>, a fork of JSON::XS by Reini Urban, which
  supports some of these.
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_singlequote
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  invalid JSON texts that contain strings that begin and end with
  single quotation marks. C<encode> will not be affected in anyway.
  I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid JSON texts
  as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration
  files, resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode(qq|{"foo":'bar'}|);
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode(qq|{'foo':"bar"}|);
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode(qq|{'foo':'bar'}|);
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_barekey
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  invalid JSON texts that contain JSON objects whose names don't
  begin and end with quotation marks. C<encode> will not be affected
  in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid JSON
  texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration
  files, resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode(qq|{foo:"bar"}|);
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_bignum
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  big integers Perl cannot handle as integer into L<Math::BigInt>
  objects and convert floating numbers into L<Math::BigFloat>
  objects. C<encode> will convert C<Math::BigInt> and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See also L<MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
      $enabled = $json->get_loose
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  invalid JSON texts that contain unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x5c]
  characters. C<encode> will not be affected in anyway.
  I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid JSON texts
  as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration
  files, resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
      $enabled = $json->get_escape_slash
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will explicitly
  escape I<slash> (solidus; C<U+002F>) characters to reduce the risk of
  XSS (cross site scripting) that may be caused by C<< </script> >>
  in a JSON text, with the cost of bloating the size of JSON texts.
  
  This option may be useful when you embed JSON in HTML, but embedding
  arbitrary JSON in HTML (by some HTML template toolkit or by string
  interpolation) is risky in general. You must escape necessary
  characters in correct order, depending on the context.
  
  C<decode> will not be affected in anyway.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($number_of_spaces)
      $length = $json->get_indent_length
  
  This option is only useful when you also enable C<indent> or C<pretty>.
  
  JSON::XS indents with three spaces when you C<encode> (if requested
  by C<indent> or C<pretty>), and the number cannot be changed.
  JSON::PP allows you to change/get the number of indent spaces with these
  mutator/accessor. The default number of spaces is three (the same as
  JSON::XS), and the acceptable range is from C<0> (no indentation;
  it'd be better to disable indentation by C<indent(0)>) to C<15>.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($code_ref)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_name)
  
  If you just want to sort keys (names) in JSON objects when you
  C<encode>, enable C<canonical> option (see above) that allows you to
  sort object keys alphabetically.
  
  If you do need to sort non-alphabetically for whatever reasons,
  you can give a code reference (or a subroutine name) to C<sort_by>,
  then the argument will be passed to Perl's C<sort> built-in function.
  
  As the sorting is done in the JSON::PP scope, you usually need to
  prepend C<JSON::PP::> to the subroutine name, and the special variables
  C<$a> and C<$b> used in the subrontine used by C<sort> function.
  
  Example:
  
     my %ORDER = (id => 1, class => 2, name => 3);
     $json->sort_by(sub {
         ($ORDER{$JSON::PP::a} // 999) <=> ($ORDER{$JSON::PP::b} // 999)
         or $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b
     });
     print $json->encode([
         {name => 'CPAN', id => 1, href => 'http://cpan.org'}
     ]);
     # [{"id":1,"name":"CPAN","href":"http://cpan.org"}]
  
  Note that C<sort_by> affects all the plain hashes in the data structure.
  If you need finer control, C<tie> necessary hashes with a module that
  implements ordered hash (such as L<Hash::Ordered> and L<Tie::IxHash>).
  C<canonical> and C<sort_by> don't affect the key order in C<tie>d
  hashes.
  
     use Hash::Ordered;
     tie my %hash, 'Hash::Ordered',
         (name => 'CPAN', id => 1, href => 'http://cpan.org');
     print $json->encode([\%hash]);
     # [{"name":"CPAN","id":1,"href":"http://cpan.org"}] # order is kept
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  This section is also taken from JSON::XS.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON
  texts. While this module always has to keep both JSON text and resulting
  Perl data structure in memory at one time, it does allow you to parse a
  JSON stream incrementally. It does so by accumulating text until it has
  a full JSON object, which it then can decode. This process is similar to
  using C<decode_prefix> to see if a full JSON object is available, but
  is much more efficient (and can be implemented with a minimum of method
  calls).
  
  JSON::PP will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect mismatched
  parentheses. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators (other than
  whitespace) between the JSON objects or arrays, instead they must be
  concatenated back-to-back. If an error occurs, an exception will be
  raised as in the scalar context case. Note that in this case, any
  previously-parsed JSON texts will be lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return
  them.
  
      my @objs = JSON::PP->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  That means you can only use this function to look at or manipulate text
  before or after complete JSON objects, not while the parser is in the
  middle of parsing a JSON object.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove
  the parsed text from the input buffer so far. This is useful after
  C<incr_parse> died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser
  state is left unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the
  parse state.
  
  The difference to C<incr_reset> is that only text until the parse error
  occurred is removed.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  =head1 MAPPING
  
  Most of this section is also taken from JSON::XS.
  
  This section describes how JSON::PP maps Perl values to JSON values and
  vice versa. These mappings are designed to "do the right thing" in most
  circumstances automatically, preserving round-tripping characteristics
  (what you put in comes out as something equivalent).
  
  For the more enlightened: note that in the following descriptions,
  lowercase I<perl> refers to the Perl interpreter, while uppercase I<Perl>
  refers to the abstract Perl language itself.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserve object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, JSON::PP will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, JSON::PP only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enabled, big integer values and any numeric
  values will be converted into L<Math::BigInt> and L<Math::BigFloat>
  objects respectively, without becoming string scalars or losing
  precision.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::PP::true> and C<JSON::PP::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::PP::is_bool> function.
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  =item shell-style comments (C<< # I<text> >>)
  
  As a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax that is enabled by the
  C<relaxed> setting, shell-style comments are allowed. They can start
  anywhere outside strings and go till the end of the line.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent
  ordering in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded
  in a pseudo-random order. JSON::PP can optionally sort the hash keys
  (determined by the I<canonical> flag and/or I<sort_by> property), so
  the same data structure will serialise to the same JSON text (given
  same settings and version of JSON::PP), but this incurs a runtime
  overhead and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some
  JSON text against another for equality.
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::PP::false> and C<JSON::PP::true> to improve
  readability.
  
     to_json [\0, JSON::PP::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::PP::true, JSON::PP::false
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  =item JSON::PP::null
  
  This special value becomes JSON null.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON, but C<JSON::PP>
  allows various ways of handling objects. See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION>,
  below, for details.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
                  # (but for older perls)
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You cannot currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  JSON::PP (and JSON::XS) trusts what you pass to C<encode> method
  (or C<encode_json> function) is a clean, validated data structure with
  values that can be represented as valid JSON values only, because it's
  not from an external data source (as opposed to JSON texts you pass to
  C<decode> or C<decode_json>, which JSON::PP considers tainted and
  doesn't trust). As JSON::PP doesn't know exactly what you and consumers
  of your JSON texts want the unexpected values to be (you may want to
  convert them into null, or to stringify them with or without
  normalisation (string representation of infinities/NaN may vary
  depending on platforms), or to croak without conversion), you're advised
  to do what you and your consumers need before you encode, and also not
  to numify values that may start with values that look like a number
  (including infinities/NaN), without validating.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 OBJECT SERIALISATION
  
  As for Perl objects, JSON::PP only supports a pure JSON representation (without the ability to deserialise the object automatically again).
  
  =head3 SERIALISATION
  
  What happens when C<JSON::PP> encounters a Perl object depends on the
  C<allow_blessed>, C<convert_blessed> and C<allow_bignum> settings, which are
  used in this order:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1. C<convert_blessed> is enabled and the object has a C<TO_JSON> method.
  
  In this case, the C<TO_JSON> method of the object is invoked in scalar
  context. It must return a single scalar that can be directly encoded into
  JSON. This scalar replaces the object in the JSON text.
  
  For example, the following C<TO_JSON> method will convert all L<URI>
  objects to JSON strings when serialised. The fact that these values
  originally were L<URI> objects is lost.
  
     sub URI::TO_JSON {
        my ($uri) = @_;
        $uri->as_string
     }
  
  =item 2. C<allow_bignum> is enabled and the object is a C<Math::BigInt> or C<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  The object will be serialised as a JSON number value.
  
  =item 3. C<allow_blessed> is enabled.
  
  The object will be serialised as a JSON null value.
  
  =item 4. none of the above
  
  If none of the settings are enabled or the respective methods are missing,
  C<JSON::PP> throws an exception.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES
  
  This section is taken from JSON::XS.
  
  The interested reader might have seen a number of flags that signify
  encodings or codesets - C<utf8>, C<latin1> and C<ascii>. There seems to be
  some confusion on what these do, so here is a short comparison:
  
  C<utf8> controls whether the JSON text created by C<encode> (and expected
  by C<decode>) is UTF-8 encoded or not, while C<latin1> and C<ascii> only
  control whether C<encode> escapes character values outside their respective
  codeset range. Neither of these flags conflict with each other, although
  some combinations make less sense than others.
  
  Care has been taken to make all flags symmetrical with respect to
  C<encode> and C<decode>, that is, texts encoded with any combination of
  these flag values will be correctly decoded when the same flags are used
  - in general, if you use different flag settings while encoding vs. when
  decoding you likely have a bug somewhere.
  
  Below comes a verbose discussion of these flags. Note that a "codeset" is
  simply an abstract set of character-codepoint pairs, while an encoding
  takes those codepoint numbers and I<encodes> them, in our case into
  octets. Unicode is (among other things) a codeset, UTF-8 is an encoding,
  and ISO-8859-1 (= latin 1) and ASCII are both codesets I<and> encodings at
  the same time, which can be confusing.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item C<utf8> flag disabled
  
  When C<utf8> is disabled (the default), then C<encode>/C<decode> generate
  and expect Unicode strings, that is, characters with high ordinal Unicode
  values (> 255) will be encoded as such characters, and likewise such
  characters are decoded as-is, no changes to them will be done, except
  "(re-)interpreting" them as Unicode codepoints or Unicode characters,
  respectively (to Perl, these are the same thing in strings unless you do
  funny/weird/dumb stuff).
  
  This is useful when you want to do the encoding yourself (e.g. when you
  want to have UTF-16 encoded JSON texts) or when some other layer does
  the encoding for you (for example, when printing to a terminal using a
  filehandle that transparently encodes to UTF-8 you certainly do NOT want
  to UTF-8 encode your data first and have Perl encode it another time).
  
  =item C<utf8> flag enabled
  
  If the C<utf8>-flag is enabled, C<encode>/C<decode> will encode all
  characters using the corresponding UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, and will
  expect your input strings to be encoded as UTF-8, that is, no "character"
  of the input string must have any value > 255, as UTF-8 does not allow
  that.
  
  The C<utf8> flag therefore switches between two modes: disabled means you
  will get a Unicode string in Perl, enabled means you get an UTF-8 encoded
  octet/binary string in Perl.
  
  =item C<latin1> or C<ascii> flags enabled
  
  With C<latin1> (or C<ascii>) enabled, C<encode> will escape characters
  with ordinal values > 255 (> 127 with C<ascii>) and encode the remaining
  characters as specified by the C<utf8> flag.
  
  If C<utf8> is disabled, then the result is also correctly encoded in those
  character sets (as both are proper subsets of Unicode, meaning that a
  Unicode string with all character values < 256 is the same thing as a
  ISO-8859-1 string, and a Unicode string with all character values < 128 is
  the same thing as an ASCII string in Perl).
  
  If C<utf8> is enabled, you still get a correct UTF-8-encoded string,
  regardless of these flags, just some more characters will be escaped using
  C<\uXXXX> then before.
  
  Note that ISO-8859-1-I<encoded> strings are not compatible with UTF-8
  encoding, while ASCII-encoded strings are. That is because the ISO-8859-1
  encoding is NOT a subset of UTF-8 (despite the ISO-8859-1 I<codeset> being
  a subset of Unicode), while ASCII is.
  
  Surprisingly, C<decode> will ignore these flags and so treat all input
  values as governed by the C<utf8> flag. If it is disabled, this allows you
  to decode ISO-8859-1- and ASCII-encoded strings, as both strict subsets of
  Unicode. If it is enabled, you can correctly decode UTF-8 encoded strings.
  
  So neither C<latin1> nor C<ascii> are incompatible with the C<utf8> flag -
  they only govern when the JSON output engine escapes a character or not.
  
  The main use for C<latin1> is to relatively efficiently store binary data
  as JSON, at the expense of breaking compatibility with most JSON decoders.
  
  The main use for C<ascii> is to force the output to not contain characters
  with values > 127, which means you can interpret the resulting string
  as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ASCII, KOI8-R or most about any character set and
  8-bit-encoding, and still get the same data structure back. This is useful
  when your channel for JSON transfer is not 8-bit clean or the encoding
  might be mangled in between (e.g. in mail), and works because ASCII is a
  proper subset of most 8-bit and multibyte encodings in use in the world.

      cpandoc http://darkpan.org/Eval::WithLexicals::AndGlobals
          -- URLs work too!
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<cpandoc> is a perl script that acts like C<perldoc> except that
  if it would have bailed out with
  C<No documentation found for "Uninstalled::Module">, it will instead
  scrape a CPAN index for the module's documentation.
  
  One important feature of C<cpandoc> is that it I<only> scrapes the
  live index if you do not have the module installed. So if you use
  C<cpandoc> on a module you already have installed, then it will
  just read the already-installed documentation. This means that the
  version of the documentation matches up with the version of the
  code you have. As a fringe benefit, C<cpandoc> will be fast for
  modules you've installed. :)
  
  All this means that you should be able to drop in C<cpandoc> in
  place of C<perldoc> and have everything keep working. See
  L</SNEAKY INSTALL> for how to do this.
  
  If you set the environment variable C<CPANDOC_FETCH> to a true value,
  then we will print a message to STDERR telling you that C<cpandoc> is
  going to make a request against the live CPAN index.

      then: alias perldoc=cpandoc
      or:   function perldoc () { cpandoc "$@" }
  
      Now `perldoc Acme::BadExample` works!
  
  C<perldoc> should continue to work for everything that you're used
  to, since C<cpandoc> passes all options through to it. C<cpandoc>
  is merely a subclass that falls back to scraping a CPAN index when
  it fails to find your queried file in C<@INC>.

  C<List::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being
  individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<List::Util> does not export any subroutines.

  =head1 LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions all reduce a list down to a single value.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 reduce
  
      $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list
  
  Reduces C<@list> by calling C<BLOCK> in a scalar context multiple times,
  setting C<$a> and C<$b> each time. The first call will be with C<$a> and C<$b>
  set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be done by
  setting C<$a> to the result of the previous call and C<$b> to the next element
  in the list.
  
  Returns the result of the last call to the C<BLOCK>. If C<@list> is empty then
  C<undef> is returned. If C<@list> only contains one element then that element
  is returned and C<BLOCK> is not executed.
  
  The following examples all demonstrate how C<reduce> could be used to implement
  the other list-reduction functions in this module. (They are not in fact
  implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient manner in individual C
  functions).
  
      $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
                      $code->(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
                                               undef } undef, @list # first
  
      $foo = reduce { $a > $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
      $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } 'A'..'Z'   # maxstr
      $foo = reduce { $a < $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
      $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } 'aa'..'zz' # minstr
      $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
      $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat
  
      $foo = reduce { $a || $code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
      $foo = reduce { $a && $code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
      $foo = reduce { $a && !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
      $foo = reduce { $a || !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
         # Note that these implementations do not fully short-circuit
  
  If your algorithm requires that C<reduce> produce an identity value, then make
  sure that you always pass that identity value as the first argument to prevent
  C<undef> being returned
  
    $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value
  
  The above example code blocks also suggest how to use C<reduce> to build a
  more efficient combined version of one of these basic functions and a C<map>
  block. For example, to find the total length of all the strings in a list,
  we could use
  
      $total = sum map { length } @strings;
  
  However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the
  original list of strings, only to reduce it down to a single value again. We
  can compute the same result more efficiently by using C<reduce> with a code
  block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:
  
      $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings
  
  The remaining list-reduction functions are all specialisations of this generic
  idea.
  
  =head2 any
  
      my $bool = any { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<any> returns true if any element makes the C<BLOCK>
  return a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty then
  it returns false.
  
  Many cases of using C<grep> in a conditional can be written using C<any>
  instead, as it can short-circuit after the first true result.
  
      if( any { length > 10 } @strings ) {
          # at least one string has more than 10 characters
      }
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 all
  
      my $bool = all { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any>, except that it requires all elements of the C<@list> to
  make the C<BLOCK> return true. If any element returns false, then it returns
  false. If the C<BLOCK> never returns false or the C<@list> was empty then it
  returns true.
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 none
  
  =head2 notall
  
      my $bool = none { BLOCK } @list;
  
      my $bool = notall { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any> and L</all>, but with the return sense inverted. C<none>
  returns true only if no value in the C<@list> causes the C<BLOCK> to return
  true, and C<notall> returns true only if not all of the values do.
  
  Note: Due to XS issues the block passed may be able to access the outer @_
  directly. This is not intentional and will break under debugger.
  
  =head2 first
  
      my $val = first { BLOCK } @list;
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<first> returns the first element where the result from
  C<BLOCK> is a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty
  then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = first { defined($_) } @list    # first defined value in @list
      $foo = first { $_ > $value } @list    # first value in @list which
                                            # is greater than $value
  
  =head2 max
  
      my $num = max @list;
  
  Returns the entry in the list with the highest numerical value. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = max 1..10                # 10
      $foo = max 3,9,12               # 12
      $foo = max @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 maxstr
  
      my $str = maxstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</max>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the highest string as defined by the C<gt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = maxstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'Z'
      $foo = maxstr "hello","world"   # "world"
      $foo = maxstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 min
  
      my $num = min @list;
  
  Similar to L</max> but returns the entry in the list with the lowest numerical
  value. If the list is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = min 1..10                # 1
      $foo = min 3,9,12               # 3
      $foo = min @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 minstr
  
      my $str = minstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</min>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the lowest string as defined by the C<lt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = minstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'A'
      $foo = minstr "hello","world"   # "hello"
      $foo = minstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 product
  
      my $num = product @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.35.>
  
  Returns the numerical product of all the elements in C<@list>. If C<@list> is
  empty then C<1> is returned.
  
      $foo = product 1..10            # 3628800
      $foo = product 3,9,12           # 324
  
  =head2 sum
  
      my $num_or_undef = sum @list;
  
  Returns the numerical sum of all the elements in C<@list>. For backwards
  compatibility, if C<@list> is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = sum 1..10                # 55
      $foo = sum 3,9,12               # 24
      $foo = sum @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 sum0
  
      my $num = sum0 @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  Similar to L</sum>, except this returns 0 when given an empty list, rather
  than C<undef>.

  =head1 KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions, all inspired by L<List::Pairwise>, consume an
  even-sized list of pairs. The pairs may be key/value associations from a hash,
  or just a list of values. The functions will all preserve the original ordering
  of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same "key"
  value - nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.
  
  B<NOTE>: At the time of writing, the following C<pair*> functions that take a
  block do not modify the value of C<$_> within the block, and instead operate
  using the C<$a> and C<$b> globals instead. This has turned out to be a poor
  design, as it precludes the ability to provide a C<pairsort> function. Better
  would be to pass pair-like objects as 2-element array references in C<$_>, in
  a style similar to the return value of the C<pairs> function. At some future
  version this behaviour may be added.
  
  Until then, users are alerted B<NOT> to rely on the value of C<$_> remaining
  unmodified between the outside and the inside of the control block. In
  particular, the following example is B<UNSAFE>:
  
   my @kvlist = ...
  
   foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  Instead, write this using a lexical variable:
  
   foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 pairs
  
      my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of C<ARRAY> references, each containing two items from the
  given list. It is a more efficient version of
  
      @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist
  
  It is most convenient to use in a C<foreach> loop, for example:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
         ...
      }
  
  Since version C<1.39> these C<ARRAY> references are blessed objects,
  recognising the two methods C<key> and C<value>. The following code is
  equivalent:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my $key   = $pair->key;
         my $value = $pair->value;
         ...
      }
  
  =head2 unpairs
  
      my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs
  
  I<Since version 1.42.>
  
  The inverse function to C<pairs>; this function takes a list of C<ARRAY>
  references containing two elements each, and returns a flattened list of the
  two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally equivalent to
  
      my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs
  
  except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for
  any input item it will extract exactly two values for the output list; using
  C<undef> if the input array references are short.
  
  Between C<pairs> and C<unpairs>, a higher-order list function can be used to
  operate on the pairs as single scalars; such as the following near-equivalents
  of the other C<pair*> higher-order functions:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
      @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
  Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.
  
  Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair
  list; e.g.:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a->key cmp $b->key } pairs @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairkeys
  
      my @keys = pairkeys @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the first values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @keys = pairmap { $a } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairvalues
  
      my @values = pairvalues @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the second values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @values = pairmap { $b } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairgrep
  
      my @kvlist = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<grep> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns an even-sized list of those pairs for which the C<BLOCK> returned true
  in list context, or the count of the B<number of pairs> in scalar context.
  (Note, therefore, in scalar context that it returns a number half the size of
  the count of items it would have returned in list context).
  
      @subset = pairgrep { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairgrep> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairfirst
  
      my ( $key, $val ) = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $found = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.30.>
  
  Similar to the L</first> function, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the first pair of values from the list for which the C<BLOCK> returned
  true in list context, or an empty list of no such pair was found. In scalar
  context it returns a simple boolean value, rather than either the key or the
  value found.
  
      ( $key, $value ) = pairfirst { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairfirst> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairmap
  
      my @list = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<map> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in list
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the concatenation of all the values returned by the C<BLOCK> in list
  context, or the count of the number of items that would have been returned in
  scalar context.
  
      @result = pairmap { "The key $a has value $b" } @kvlist
  
  As with C<map> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairmap> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  See L</KNOWN BUGS> for a known-bug with C<pairmap>, and a workaround.

  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 shuffle
  
      my @values = shuffle @values;
  
  Returns the values of the input in a random order
  
      @cards = shuffle 0..51      # 0..51 in a random order
  
  =head2 uniq
  
      my @subset = uniq @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  DWIM-ish string equality or C<undef> test. Preserves the order of unique
  elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniq @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  The C<undef> value is treated by this function as distinct from the empty
  string, and no warning will be produced. It is left as-is in the returned
  list. Subsequent C<undef> values are still considered identical to the first,
  and will be removed.
  
  =head2 uniqnum
  
      my @subset = uniqnum @values
  
  I<Since version 1.44.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  numerical equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains
  the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqnum @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it
  compares equal to zero but additionally produces a warning if such warnings
  are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an C<undef> in
  the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
  values returned by C<uniqnum> are well-behaved as numbers.
  
  Note also that multiple IEEE C<NaN> values are treated as duplicates of
  each other, regardless of any differences in their payloads, and despite
  the fact that C<< 0+'NaN' == 0+'NaN' >> yields false.
  
  =head2 uniqstr
  
      my @subset = uniqstr @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  string equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the
  first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqstr @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other string operations treat it; it
  compares equal to the empty string but additionally produces a warning if such
  warnings are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an
  C<undef> in the returned list is coerced into an empty string, so that the
  entire list of values returned by C<uniqstr> are well-behaved as strings.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 head
  
      my @values = head $size, @list;
  
  Returns the first C<$size> elements from C<@list>. If C<$size> is negative, returns
  all but the last C<$size> elements from C<@list>.
  
      @result = head 2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # foo, bar
  
      @result = head -2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # foo
  
  =head2 tail
  
      my @values = tail $size, @list;
  
  Returns the last C<$size> elements from C<@list>. If C<$size> is negative, returns
  all but the first C<$size> elements from C<@list>.
  
      @result = tail 2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # bar, baz
  
      @result = tail -2, qw( foo bar baz );
      # baz
  
  =head1 KNOWN BUGS
  
  =head2 RT #95409
  
  L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95409>
  
  If the block of code given to L</pairmap> contains lexical variables that are
  captured by a returned closure, and the closure is executed after the block
  has been re-used for the next iteration, these lexicals will not see the
  correct values. For example:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      my $var = "$a is $b";
      sub { print "$var\n" };
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
   $_->() for @subs;
  
  Will incorrectly print
  
   three is 3
   three is 3
   three is 3
  
  This is due to the performance optimisation of using C<MULTICALL> for the code
  block, which means that fresh SVs do not get allocated for each call to the
  block. Instead, the same SV is re-assigned for each iteration, and all the
  closures will share the value seen on the final iteration.
  
  To work around this bug, surround the code with a second set of braces. This
  creates an inner block that defeats the C<MULTICALL> logic, and does get fresh
  SVs allocated each time:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      {
         my $var = "$a is $b";
         sub { print "$var\n"; }
      }
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
  This bug only affects closures that are generated by the block but used
  afterwards. Lexical variables that are only used during the lifetime of the
  block's execution will take their individual values for each invocation, as
  normal.
  
  =head2 uniqnum() on oversized bignums
  
  Due to the way that C<uniqnum()> compares numbers, it cannot distinguish
  differences between bignums (especially bigints) that are too large to fit in
  the native platform types. For example,
  
   my $x = Math::BigInt->new( "1" x 100 );
   my $y = $x + 1;
  
   say for uniqnum( $x, $y );
  
  Will print just the value of C<$x>, believing that C<$y> is a numerically-
  equivalent value. This bug does not affect C<uniqstr()>, which will correctly
  observe that the two values stringify to different strings.
  
  =head1 SUGGESTED ADDITIONS
  
  The following are additions that have been requested, but I have been reluctant
  to add due to them being very simple to implement in perl
  
    # How many elements are true
  
    sub true { scalar grep { $_ } @_ }
  
    # How many elements are false
  
    sub false { scalar grep { !$_ } @_ }

  Scalar::Util - A selection of general-utility scalar subroutines
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Scalar::Util qw(blessed dualvar isdual readonly refaddr reftype
                          tainted weaken isweak isvstring looks_like_number

                          # and other useful utils appearing below
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Scalar::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size would be so small that 
  being individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<Scalar::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS FOR REFERENCES
  
  The following functions all perform some useful activity on reference values.
  
  =head2 blessed
  
      my $pkg = blessed( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a blessed reference, the name of the package that it is blessed
  into is returned. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $scalar = "foo";
      $class  = blessed $scalar;           # undef
  
      $ref    = [];
      $class  = blessed $ref;              # undef
  
      $obj    = bless [], "Foo";
      $class  = blessed $obj;              # "Foo"
  
  Take care when using this function simply as a truth test (such as in
  C<if(blessed $ref)...>) because the package name C<"0"> is defined yet false.
  
  =head2 refaddr
  
      my $addr = refaddr( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is reference, the internal memory address of the referenced value is
  returned as a plain integer. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $addr = refaddr "string";           # undef
      $addr = refaddr \$var;              # eg 12345678
      $addr = refaddr [];                 # eg 23456784
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $addr = refaddr $obj;               # eg 88123488
  
  =head2 reftype
  
      my $type = reftype( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a reference, the basic Perl type of the variable referenced is
  returned as a plain string (such as C<ARRAY> or C<HASH>). Otherwise C<undef>
  is returned.
  
      $type = reftype "string";           # undef
      $type = reftype \$var;              # SCALAR
      $type = reftype [];                 # ARRAY
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $type = reftype $obj;               # HASH
  
  =head2 weaken
  
      weaken( $ref );
  
  The lvalue C<$ref> will be turned into a weak reference. This means that it
  will not hold a reference count on the object it references. Also, when the
  reference count on that object reaches zero, the reference will be set to
  undef. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its argument and returns no
  value.
  
  This is useful for keeping copies of references, but you don't want to prevent
  the object being DESTROY-ed at its usual time.
  
      {
        my $var;
        $ref = \$var;
        weaken($ref);                     # Make $ref a weak reference
      }
      # $ref is now undef
  
  Note that if you take a copy of a scalar with a weakened reference, the copy
  will be a strong reference.
  
      my $var;
      my $foo = \$var;
      weaken($foo);                       # Make $foo a weak reference
      my $bar = $foo;                     # $bar is now a strong reference
  
  This may be less obvious in other situations, such as C<grep()>, for instance
  when grepping through a list of weakened references to objects that may have
  been destroyed already:
  
      @object = grep { defined } @object;
  
  This will indeed remove all references to destroyed objects, but the remaining
  references to objects will be strong, causing the remaining objects to never be
  destroyed because there is now always a strong reference to them in the @object
  array.
  
  =head2 unweaken
  
      unweaken( $ref );
  
  I<Since version 1.36.>
  
  The lvalue C<REF> will be turned from a weak reference back into a normal
  (strong) reference again. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its
  argument and returns no value. This undoes the action performed by
  L</weaken>.
  
  This function is slightly neater and more convenient than the
  otherwise-equivalent code
  
      my $tmp = $REF;
      undef $REF;
      $REF = $tmp;
  
  (because in particular, simply assigning a weak reference back to itself does
  not work to unweaken it; C<$REF = $REF> does not work).
  
  =head2 isweak
  
      my $weak = isweak( $ref );
  
  Returns true if C<$ref> is a weak reference.
  
      $ref  = \$foo;
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # false
      weaken($ref);
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # true
  
  B<NOTE>: Copying a weak reference creates a normal, strong, reference.
  
      $copy = $ref;
      $weak = isweak($copy);              # false
  
  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 dualvar
  
      my $var = dualvar( $num, $string );
  
  Returns a scalar that has the value C<$num> in a numeric context and the value
  C<$string> in a string context.
  
      $foo = dualvar 10, "Hello";
      $num = $foo + 2;                    # 12
      $str = $foo . " world";             # Hello world
  
  =head2 isdual
  
      my $dual = isdual( $var );
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar that has both numeric and string values, the result is
  true.
  
      $foo = dualvar 86, "Nix";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that a scalar can be made to have both string and numeric content through
  numeric operations:
  
      $foo = "10";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # false
      $bar = $foo + 0;
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that although C<$!> appears to be a dual-valued variable, it is
  actually implemented as a magical variable inside the interpreter:
  
      $! = 1;
      print("$!\n");                      # "Operation not permitted"
      $dual = isdual($!);                 # false
  
  You can capture its numeric and string content using:
  
      $err = dualvar $!, $!;
      $dual = isdual($err);               # true
  
  =head2 isvstring
  
      my $vstring = isvstring( $var );
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar which was coded as a vstring, the result is true.
  
      $vs   = v49.46.48;
      $fmt  = isvstring($vs) ? "%vd" : "%s"; #true
      printf($fmt,$vs);
  
  =head2 looks_like_number
  
      my $isnum = looks_like_number( $var );
  
  Returns true if perl thinks C<$var> is a number. See
  L<perlapi/looks_like_number>.
  
  =head2 openhandle
  
      my $fh = openhandle( $fh );
  
  Returns C<$fh> itself if C<$fh> may be used as a filehandle and is open, or is
  is a tied handle. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $fh = openhandle(*STDIN);           # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(\*STDIN);          # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(*NOTOPEN);         # undef
      $fh = openhandle("scalar");         # undef
  
  =head2 readonly
  
      my $ro = readonly( $var );
  
  Returns true if C<$var> is readonly.
  
      sub foo { readonly($_[0]) }
  
      $readonly = foo($bar);              # false
      $readonly = foo(0);                 # true
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype( $code, $prototype );
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
      set_prototype \&foo, '$$';
  
  =head2 tainted
  
      my $t = tainted( $var );
  
  Return true if C<$var> is tainted.
  
      $taint = tainted("constant");       # false
      $taint = tainted($ENV{PWD});        # true if running under -T

  Sub::Util - A selection of utility subroutines for subs and CODE references
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Sub::Util qw( prototype set_prototype subname set_subname );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Sub::Util> contains a selection of utility subroutines that are useful for
  operating on subs and CODE references.
  
  The rationale for inclusion in this module is that the function performs some
  work for which an XS implementation is essential because it cannot be
  implemented in Pure Perl, and which is sufficiently-widely used across CPAN
  that its popularity warrants inclusion in a core module, which this is.

  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 prototype
  
      my $proto = prototype( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the prototype of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one, as a
  string. This is the same as the C<CORE::prototype> operator; it is included
  here simply for symmetry and completeness with the other functions.
  
  =cut
  
  sub prototype
  {
    my ( $code ) = @_;
    return CORE::prototype( $code );
  }
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype $prototype, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
  I<Caution>: This function takes arguments in a different order to the previous
  copy of the code from C<Scalar::Util>. This is to match the order of
  C<set_subname>, and other potential additions in this file. This order has
  been chosen as it allows a neat and simple chaining of other
  C<Sub::Util::set_*> functions as might become available, such as:
  
   my $code =
      set_subname   name_here =>
      set_prototype '&@'      =>
      set_attribute ':lvalue' =>
         sub { ...... };
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 subname
  
      my $name = subname( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the name of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one. Normal named
  subs will give a fully-qualified name consisting of the package and the
  localname separated by C<::>. Anonymous code references will give C<__ANON__>
  as the localname. If a name has been set using L</set_subname>, this name will
  be returned instead.
  
  This function was inspired by C<sub_fullname> from L<Sub::Identify>. The
  remaining functions that C<Sub::Identify> implements can easily be emulated
  using regexp operations, such as
  
   sub get_code_info { return (subname $_[0]) =~ m/^(.+)::(.*?)$/ }
   sub sub_name      { return (get_code_info $_[0])[0] }
   sub stash_name    { return (get_code_info $_[0])[1] }
  
  I<Users of Sub::Name beware>: This function is B<not> the same as
  C<Sub::Name::subname>; it returns the existing name of the sub rather than
  changing it. To set or change a name, see instead L</set_subname>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 set_subname
  
      my $code = set_subname $name, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the name of the function given by the C<$code> reference. Returns the
  C<$code> reference itself. If the C<$name> is unqualified, the package of the
  caller is used to qualify it.
  
  This is useful for applying names to anonymous CODE references so that stack
  traces and similar situations, to give a useful name rather than having the
  default of C<__ANON__>. Note that this name is only used for this situation;
  the C<set_subname> will not install it into the symbol table; you will have to
  do that yourself if required.
  
  However, since the name is not used by perl except as the return value of
  C<caller>, for stack traces or similar, there is no actual requirement that
  the name be syntactically valid as a perl function name. This could be used to
  attach extra information that could be useful in debugging stack traces.
  
  This function was copied from C<Sub::Name::subname> and renamed to the naming
  convention of this module.
