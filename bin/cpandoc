  Pod::Cpandoc - perldoc that works for modules you don't have installed
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      cpandoc File::Find
          -- shows the documentation of your installed File::Find
  
      cpandoc Acme::BadExample
          -- works even if you don't have Acme::BadExample installed!
  
      cpandoc -c Text::Xslate
          -- shows the changelog file for Text::Xslate
  
      cpandoc -v '$?'
          -- passes everything through to regular perldoc
  
      cpandoc -m Acme::BadExample | grep system
          -- options are respected even if the module was scraped
  
      vim `cpandoc -l Web::Scraper`
          -- getting the idea yet?
  
      cpandoc http://darkpan.org/Eval::WithLexicals::AndGlobals
          -- URLs work too!
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<cpandoc> is a perl script that acts like C<perldoc> except that
  if it would have bailed out with
  C<No documentation found for "Uninstalled::Module">, it will instead
  scrape a CPAN index for the module's documentation.
  
  One important feature of C<cpandoc> is that it I<only> scrapes the
  live index if you do not have the module installed. So if you use
  C<cpandoc> on a module you already have installed, then it will
  just read the already-installed documentation. This means that the
  version of the documentation matches up with the version of the
  code you have. As a fringe benefit, C<cpandoc> will be fast for
  modules you've installed. :)
  
  All this means that you should be able to drop in C<cpandoc> in
  place of C<perldoc> and have everything keep working. See
  L</SNEAKY INSTALL> for how to do this.
  
  If you set the environment variable C<CPANDOC_FETCH> to a true value,
  then we will print a message to STDERR telling you that C<cpandoc> is
  going to make a request against the live CPAN index.
  
  =head1 TRANSLATIONS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item Japanese
  
      Japanese documentation can be found at
      L<http://perldoc.jp/docs/modules/Pod-Cpandoc-0.09/Cpandoc.pod>,
      contributed by @bayashi.

  =head1 SNEAKY INSTALL
  
      cpanm Pod::Cpandoc
  
      then: alias perldoc=cpandoc
      or:   function perldoc () { cpandoc "$@" }
  
      Now `perldoc Acme::BadExample` works!
  
  C<perldoc> should continue to work for everything that you're used
  to, since C<cpandoc> passes all options through to it. C<cpandoc>
  is merely a subclass that falls back to scraping a CPAN index when
  it fails to find your queried file in C<@INC>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  List::Util - A selection of general-utility list subroutines
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use List::Util qw(
        reduce any all none notall first
  
        max maxstr min minstr product sum sum0
  
        pairs pairkeys pairvalues pairfirst pairgrep pairmap
  
        shuffle uniqnum uniqstr
      );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<List::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being
  individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<List::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions all reduce a list down to a single value.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 reduce
  
      $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list
  
  Reduces C<@list> by calling C<BLOCK> in a scalar context multiple times,
  setting C<$a> and C<$b> each time. The first call will be with C<$a> and C<$b>
  set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be done by
  setting C<$a> to the result of the previous call and C<$b> to the next element
  in the list.
  
  Returns the result of the last call to the C<BLOCK>. If C<@list> is empty then
  C<undef> is returned. If C<@list> only contains one element then that element
  is returned and C<BLOCK> is not executed.
  
  The following examples all demonstrate how C<reduce> could be used to implement
  the other list-reduction functions in this module. (They are not in fact
  implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient manner in individual C
  functions).
  
      $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
                      $code->(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
                                               undef } undef, @list # first
  
      $foo = reduce { $a > $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
      $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } 'A'..'Z'   # maxstr
      $foo = reduce { $a < $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
      $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } 'aa'..'zz' # minstr
      $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
      $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat
  
      $foo = reduce { $a || $code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
      $foo = reduce { $a && $code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
      $foo = reduce { $a && !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
      $foo = reduce { $a || !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
         # Note that these implementations do not fully short-circuit
  
  If your algorithm requires that C<reduce> produce an identity value, then make
  sure that you always pass that identity value as the first argument to prevent
  C<undef> being returned
  
    $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value
  
  The above example code blocks also suggest how to use C<reduce> to build a
  more efficient combined version of one of these basic functions and a C<map>
  block. For example, to find the total length of the all the strings in a list,
  we could use
  
      $total = sum map { length } @strings;
  
  However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the
  original list of strings, only to reduce it down to a single value again. We
  can compute the same result more efficiently by using C<reduce> with a code
  block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:
  
      $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings
  
  The remaining list-reduction functions are all specialisations of this generic
  idea.
  
  =head2 any
  
      my $bool = any { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<any> returns true if any element makes the C<BLOCK>
  return a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty then
  it returns false.
  
  Many cases of using C<grep> in a conditional can be written using C<any>
  instead, as it can short-circuit after the first true result.
  
      if( any { length > 10 } @strings ) {
          # at least one string has more than 10 characters
      }
  
  =head2 all
  
      my $bool = all { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any>, except that it requires all elements of the C<@list> to
  make the C<BLOCK> return true. If any element returns false, then it returns
  false. If the C<BLOCK> never returns false or the C<@list> was empty then it
  returns true.
  
  =head2 none
  
  =head2 notall
  
      my $bool = none { BLOCK } @list;
  
      my $bool = notall { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any> and L</all>, but with the return sense inverted. C<none>
  returns true only if no value in the C<@list> causes the C<BLOCK> to return
  true, and C<notall> returns true only if not all of the values do.
  
  =head2 first
  
      my $val = first { BLOCK } @list;
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<first> returns the first element where the result from
  C<BLOCK> is a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty
  then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = first { defined($_) } @list    # first defined value in @list
      $foo = first { $_ > $value } @list    # first value in @list which
                                            # is greater than $value
  
  =head2 max
  
      my $num = max @list;
  
  Returns the entry in the list with the highest numerical value. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = max 1..10                # 10
      $foo = max 3,9,12               # 12
      $foo = max @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 maxstr
  
      my $str = maxstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</max>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the highest string as defined by the C<gt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = maxstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'Z'
      $foo = maxstr "hello","world"   # "world"
      $foo = maxstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 min
  
      my $num = min @list;
  
  Similar to L</max> but returns the entry in the list with the lowest numerical
  value. If the list is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = min 1..10                # 1
      $foo = min 3,9,12               # 3
      $foo = min @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 minstr
  
      my $str = minstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</min>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the lowest string as defined by the C<lt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = minstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'A'
      $foo = minstr "hello","world"   # "hello"
      $foo = minstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 product
  
      my $num = product @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.35.>
  
  Returns the numerical product of all the elements in C<@list>. If C<@list> is
  empty then C<1> is returned.
  
      $foo = product 1..10            # 3628800
      $foo = product 3,9,12           # 324
  
  =head2 sum
  
      my $num_or_undef = sum @list;
  
  Returns the numerical sum of all the elements in C<@list>. For backwards
  compatibility, if C<@list> is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = sum 1..10                # 55
      $foo = sum 3,9,12               # 24
      $foo = sum @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 sum0
  
      my $num = sum0 @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  Similar to L</sum>, except this returns 0 when given an empty list, rather
  than C<undef>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions, all inspired by L<List::Pairwise>, consume an
  even-sized list of pairs. The pairs may be key/value associations from a hash,
  or just a list of values. The functions will all preserve the original ordering
  of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same "key"
  value - nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.
  
  B<NOTE>: At the time of writing, the following C<pair*> functions that take a
  block do not modify the value of C<$_> within the block, and instead operate
  using the C<$a> and C<$b> globals instead. This has turned out to be a poor
  design, as it precludes the ability to provide a C<pairsort> function. Better
  would be to pass pair-like objects as 2-element array references in C<$_>, in
  a style similar to the return value of the C<pairs> function. At some future
  version this behaviour may be added.
  
  Until then, users are alerted B<NOT> to rely on the value of C<$_> remaining
  unmodified between the outside and the inside of the control block. In
  particular, the following example is B<UNSAFE>:
  
   my @kvlist = ...
  
   foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  Instead, write this using a lexical variable:
  
   foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 pairs
  
      my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of C<ARRAY> references, each containing two items from the
  given list. It is a more efficient version of
  
      @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist
  
  It is most convenient to use in a C<foreach> loop, for example:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
         ...
      }
  
  Since version C<1.39> these C<ARRAY> references are blessed objects,
  recognising the two methods C<key> and C<value>. The following code is
  equivalent:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my $key   = $pair->key;
         my $value = $pair->value;
         ...
      }
  
  =head2 unpairs
  
      my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs
  
  I<Since version 1.42.>
  
  The inverse function to C<pairs>; this function takes a list of C<ARRAY>
  references containing two elements each, and returns a flattened list of the
  two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally equivalent to
  
      my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs
  
  except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for
  any input item it will extract exactly two values for the output list; using
  C<undef> if the input array references are short.
  
  Between C<pairs> and C<unpairs>, a higher-order list function can be used to
  operate on the pairs as single scalars; such as the following near-equivalents
  of the other C<pair*> higher-order functions:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
      @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
  Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.
  
  Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair
  list; e.g.:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a->key cmp $b->key } pairs @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairkeys
  
      my @keys = pairkeys @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the first values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @keys = pairmap { $a } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairvalues
  
      my @values = pairvalues @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the second values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @values = pairmap { $b } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairgrep
  
      my @kvlist = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<grep> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns an even-sized list of those pairs for which the C<BLOCK> returned true
  in list context, or the count of the B<number of pairs> in scalar context.
  (Note, therefore, in scalar context that it returns a number half the size of
  the count of items it would have returned in list context).
  
      @subset = pairgrep { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairgrep> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairfirst
  
      my ( $key, $val ) = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $found = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.30.>
  
  Similar to the L</first> function, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the first pair of values from the list for which the C<BLOCK> returned
  true in list context, or an empty list of no such pair was found. In scalar
  context it returns a simple boolean value, rather than either the key or the
  value found.
  
      ( $key, $value ) = pairfirst { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairfirst> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairmap
  
      my @list = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<map> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in list
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the concatenation of all the values returned by the C<BLOCK> in list
  context, or the count of the number of items that would have been returned in
  scalar context.
  
      @result = pairmap { "The key $a has value $b" } @kvlist
  
  As with C<map> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairmap> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  See L</KNOWN BUGS> for a known-bug with C<pairmap>, and a workaround.

  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 shuffle
  
      my @values = shuffle @values;
  
  Returns the values of the input in a random order
  
      @cards = shuffle 0..51      # 0..51 in a random order
  
  =head2 uniq
  
      my @subset = uniq @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  DWIM-ish string equality or C<undef> test. Preserves the order of unique
  elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniq @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  The C<undef> value is treated by this function as distinct from the empty
  string, and no warning will be produced. It is left as-is in the returned
  list. Subsequent C<undef> values are still considered identical to the first,
  and will be removed.
  
  =head2 uniqnum
  
      my @subset = uniqnum @values
  
  I<Since version 1.44.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  numerical equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains
  the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqnum @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it
  compares equal to zero but additionally produces a warning if such warnings
  are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an C<undef> in
  the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
  values returned by C<uniqnum> are well-behaved as numbers.
  
  =head2 uniqstr
  
      my @subset = uniqstr @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  string equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the
  first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqstr @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other string operations treat it; it
  compares equal to the empty string but additionally produces a warning if such
  warnings are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an
  C<undef> in the returned list is coerced into an empty string, so that the
  entire list of values returned by C<uniqstr> are well-behaved as strings.

  =head1 KNOWN BUGS
  
  =head2 RT #95409
  
  L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95409>
  
  If the block of code given to L</pairmap> contains lexical variables that are
  captured by a returned closure, and the closure is executed after the block
  has been re-used for the next iteration, these lexicals will not see the
  correct values. For example:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      my $var = "$a is $b";
      sub { print "$var\n" };
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
   $_->() for @subs;
  
  Will incorrectly print
  
   three is 3
   three is 3
   three is 3
  
  This is due to the performance optimisation of using C<MULTICALL> for the code
  block, which means that fresh SVs do not get allocated for each call to the
  block. Instead, the same SV is re-assigned for each iteration, and all the
  closures will share the value seen on the final iteration.
  
  To work around this bug, surround the code with a second set of braces. This
  creates an inner block that defeats the C<MULTICALL> logic, and does get fresh
  SVs allocated each time:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      {
         my $var = "$a is $b";
         sub { print "$var\n"; }
      }
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
  This bug only affects closures that are generated by the block but used
  afterwards. Lexical variables that are only used during the lifetime of the
  block's execution will take their individual values for each invocation, as
  normal.
  
  =head2 uniqnum() on oversized bignums
  
  Due to the way that C<uniqnum()> compares numbers, it cannot distinguish
  differences between bignums (especially bigints) that are too large to fit in
  the native platform types. For example,
  
   my $x = Math::BigInt->new( "1" x 100 );
   my $y = $x + 1;
  
   say for uniqnum( $x, $y );
  
  Will print just the value of C<$x>, believing that C<$y> is a numerically-
  equivalent value. This bug does not affect C<uniqstr()>, which will correctly
  observe that the two values stringify to different strings.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Scalar::Util - A selection of general-utility scalar subroutines
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Scalar::Util qw(blessed dualvar isdual readonly refaddr reftype
                          tainted weaken isweak isvstring looks_like_number
                          set_prototype);
                          # and other useful utils appearing below
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Scalar::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size would be so small that 
  being individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<Scalar::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS FOR REFERENCES
  
  The following functions all perform some useful activity on reference values.
  
  =head2 blessed
  
      my $pkg = blessed( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a blessed reference, the name of the package that it is blessed
  into is returned. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $scalar = "foo";
      $class  = blessed $scalar;           # undef
  
      $ref    = [];
      $class  = blessed $ref;              # undef
  
      $obj    = bless [], "Foo";
      $class  = blessed $obj;              # "Foo"
  
  Take care when using this function simply as a truth test (such as in
  C<if(blessed $ref)...>) because the package name C<"0"> is defined yet false.
  
  =head2 refaddr
  
      my $addr = refaddr( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is reference, the internal memory address of the referenced value is
  returned as a plain integer. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $addr = refaddr "string";           # undef
      $addr = refaddr \$var;              # eg 12345678
      $addr = refaddr [];                 # eg 23456784
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $addr = refaddr $obj;               # eg 88123488
  
  =head2 reftype
  
      my $type = reftype( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a reference, the basic Perl type of the variable referenced is
  returned as a plain string (such as C<ARRAY> or C<HASH>). Otherwise C<undef>
  is returned.
  
      $type = reftype "string";           # undef
      $type = reftype \$var;              # SCALAR
      $type = reftype [];                 # ARRAY
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $type = reftype $obj;               # HASH
  
  =head2 weaken
  
      weaken( $ref );
  
  The lvalue C<$ref> will be turned into a weak reference. This means that it
  will not hold a reference count on the object it references. Also, when the
  reference count on that object reaches zero, the reference will be set to
  undef. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its argument and returns no
  value.
  
  This is useful for keeping copies of references, but you don't want to prevent
  the object being DESTROY-ed at its usual time.
  
      {
        my $var;
        $ref = \$var;
        weaken($ref);                     # Make $ref a weak reference
      }
      # $ref is now undef
  
  Note that if you take a copy of a scalar with a weakened reference, the copy
  will be a strong reference.
  
      my $var;
      my $foo = \$var;
      weaken($foo);                       # Make $foo a weak reference
      my $bar = $foo;                     # $bar is now a strong reference
  
  This may be less obvious in other situations, such as C<grep()>, for instance
  when grepping through a list of weakened references to objects that may have
  been destroyed already:
  
      @object = grep { defined } @object;
  
  This will indeed remove all references to destroyed objects, but the remaining
  references to objects will be strong, causing the remaining objects to never be
  destroyed because there is now always a strong reference to them in the @object
  array.
  
  =head2 unweaken
  
      unweaken( $ref );
  
  I<Since version 1.36.>
  
  The lvalue C<REF> will be turned from a weak reference back into a normal
  (strong) reference again. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its
  argument and returns no value. This undoes the action performed by
  L</weaken>.
  
  This function is slightly neater and more convenient than the
  otherwise-equivalent code
  
      my $tmp = $REF;
      undef $REF;
      $REF = $tmp;
  
  (because in particular, simply assigning a weak reference back to itself does
  not work to unweaken it; C<$REF = $REF> does not work).
  
  =head2 isweak
  
      my $weak = isweak( $ref );
  
  Returns true if C<$ref> is a weak reference.
  
      $ref  = \$foo;
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # false
      weaken($ref);
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # true
  
  B<NOTE>: Copying a weak reference creates a normal, strong, reference.
  
      $copy = $ref;
      $weak = isweak($copy);              # false
  
  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 dualvar
  
      my $var = dualvar( $num, $string );
  
  Returns a scalar that has the value C<$num> in a numeric context and the value
  C<$string> in a string context.
  
      $foo = dualvar 10, "Hello";
      $num = $foo + 2;                    # 12
      $str = $foo . " world";             # Hello world
  
  =head2 isdual
  
      my $dual = isdual( $var );
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar that has both numeric and string values, the result is
  true.
  
      $foo = dualvar 86, "Nix";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that a scalar can be made to have both string and numeric content through
  numeric operations:
  
      $foo = "10";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # false
      $bar = $foo + 0;
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that although C<$!> appears to be a dual-valued variable, it is
  actually implemented as a magical variable inside the interpreter:
  
      $! = 1;
      print("$!\n");                      # "Operation not permitted"
      $dual = isdual($!);                 # false
  
  You can capture its numeric and string content using:
  
      $err = dualvar $!, $!;
      $dual = isdual($err);               # true
  
  =head2 isvstring
  
      my $vstring = isvstring( $var );
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar which was coded as a vstring, the result is true.
  
      $vs   = v49.46.48;
      $fmt  = isvstring($vs) ? "%vd" : "%s"; #true
      printf($fmt,$vs);
  
  =head2 looks_like_number
  
      my $isnum = looks_like_number( $var );
  
  Returns true if perl thinks C<$var> is a number. See
  L<perlapi/looks_like_number>.
  
  =head2 openhandle
  
      my $fh = openhandle( $fh );
  
  Returns C<$fh> itself if C<$fh> may be used as a filehandle and is open, or is
  is a tied handle. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $fh = openhandle(*STDIN);           # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(\*STDIN);          # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(*NOTOPEN);         # undef
      $fh = openhandle("scalar");         # undef
  
  =head2 readonly
  
      my $ro = readonly( $var );
  
  Returns true if C<$var> is readonly.
  
      sub foo { readonly($_[0]) }
  
      $readonly = foo($bar);              # false
      $readonly = foo(0);                 # true
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype( $code, $prototype );
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
      set_prototype \&foo, '$$';
  
  =head2 tainted
  
      my $t = tainted( $var );
  
  Return true if C<$var> is tainted.
  
      $taint = tainted("constant");       # false
      $taint = tainted($ENV{PWD});        # true if running under -T

  =head1 NAME
  
  Sub::Util - A selection of utility subroutines for subs and CODE references
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Sub::Util qw( prototype set_prototype subname set_subname );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Sub::Util> contains a selection of utility subroutines that are useful for
  operating on subs and CODE references.
  
  The rationale for inclusion in this module is that the function performs some
  work for which an XS implementation is essential because it cannot be
  implemented in Pure Perl, and which is sufficiently-widely used across CPAN
  that its popularity warrants inclusion in a core module, which this is.

  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 prototype
  
      my $proto = prototype( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the prototype of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one, as a
  string. This is the same as the C<CORE::prototype> operator; it is included
  here simply for symmetry and completeness with the other functions.
  
  =cut
  
  sub prototype
  {
    my ( $code ) = @_;
    return CORE::prototype( $code );
  }
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype $prototype, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
  I<Caution>: This function takes arguments in a different order to the previous
  copy of the code from C<Scalar::Util>. This is to match the order of
  C<set_subname>, and other potential additions in this file. This order has
  been chosen as it allows a neat and simple chaining of other
  C<Sub::Util::set_*> functions as might become available, such as:
  
   my $code =
      set_subname   name_here =>
      set_prototype '&@'      =>
      set_attribute ':lvalue' =>
         sub { ...... };
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 subname
  
      my $name = subname( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the name of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one. Normal named
  subs will give a fully-qualified name consisting of the package and the
  localname separated by C<::>. Anonymous code references will give C<__ANON__>
  as the localname. If a name has been set using L</set_subname>, this name will
  be returned instead.
  
  This function was inspired by C<sub_fullname> from L<Sub::Identify>. The
  remaining functions that C<Sub::Identify> implements can easily be emulated
  using regexp operations, such as
  
   sub get_code_info { return (subname $_[0]) =~ m/^(.+)::(.+?)$/ }
   sub sub_name      { return (get_code_info $_[0])[0] }
   sub stash_name    { return (get_code_info $_[0])[1] }
  
  I<Users of Sub::Name beware>: This function is B<not> the same as
  C<Sub::Name::subname>; it returns the existing name of the sub rather than
  changing it. To set or change a name, see instead L</set_subname>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 set_subname
  
      my $code = set_subname $name, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the name of the function given by the C<$code> reference. Returns the
  C<$code> reference itself. If the C<$name> is unqualified, the package of the
  caller is used to qualify it.
  
  This is useful for applying names to anonymous CODE references so that stack
  traces and similar situations, to give a useful name rather than having the
  default of C<__ANON__>. Note that this name is only used for this situation;
  the C<set_subname> will not install it into the symbol table; you will have to
  do that yourself if required.
  
  However, since the name is not used by perl except as the return value of
  C<caller>, for stack traces or similar, there is no actual requirement that
  the name be syntactically valid as a perl function name. This could be used to
  attach extra information that could be useful in debugging stack traces.
  
  This function was copied from C<Sub::Name::subname> and renamed to the naming
  convention of this module.
